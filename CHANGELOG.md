## [a0.4.4] - 2026-10-06
### Added
- Parseh lives in the parseh-io organisation on GitHub; Settings → Updating Parseh looks in the new repository
- The guide is at parseh.io/guide, under a bar that leads to Parseh's site; pages exported from Parseh link to it for good
- The phone app's icons are published with the guide again
- Every address Parseh writes for itself is kept in one place, lib/project.py
- release.py links asks every address Parseh names and says what each answers
- Settings → About shows a few friendly numbers: cards answered, videos and books on the shelves, since when
- From a0.4.2: prompts of your own, the studio's prompt in parts, IPA and short-vowel options, skills for your chatbot, a book made by an agent from any device, pictograms (ARASAAC)
- From a0.4.2: a video's vocabulary in the books' entries, notes on a video's phrases, a sound in place of a video, flashcards that turn
- From a0.4.3: Whisper models for each language, optional exact word times kept through every edit of a transcript
- From a0.4.3: a transcript workspace with LM likelihood, an LLM connection, a reasoning workspace and chatbot copy-and-paste review
- From a0.4.3: partial-word colours in the studio, mobile arrow keys that skip, a card maker for books and videos

### Changed
- Speech to text lists the Whisper program first, above the second pass and the models
- a0.4.2 and a0.4.3 were finished but not released on their own: their full entries follow

### Fixed
- LLM Integration, LM likelihood and About are drawn with their own stylesheet and end in a foot like the other doors
- The README and the settings pages link to guide pages that exist

## [a0.4.3] - 2026-10-05
### Added
- A standalone reasoning-workspace CSV checker, shipped with the helper and skill, for draft checks, exact source spans and required-entry coverage
- Standard and language-specific Whisper models in one pinned catalogue, with independent resumable installs, per-language model choices and model provenance in transcription jobs

- Browser transcription workspace with video beside the transcript, word/caption replay, ±1/2/5-second playback controls, caption filters and a persistent word editor
- Brief word playback with automatic pause, installed-dictionary suspect flags and original/replacement meanings in browser transcript review
- Dictionary meanings for native Whisper alternatives alongside their recognition scores in the word inspector
- Native faster-whisper beam alternatives mapped to source words, with sequence log scores kept separate from word probabilities
- Browser Settings → LLM Integration: a reusable OpenAI-compatible endpoint, host-local credentials, model discovery and Unsloth run-settings link import

- Partial-word foreground colours in Studio, with selection-first editing, Unicode-safe boundaries, one-word linguistic clouds, PDF and standalone-HTML output

### Changed
- Transcript word editors can include adjacent words for a short-span correction; reasoning workspaces can join split words across suspect/confident neighbors
- Transcription opens directly into a shared editing workspace; correction methods are reusable tools, with optional automatic and later per-word/section Whisper rechecks
- All four transcript-correction methods are labeled experimental; LM likelihood offers no-cutoff, suggested 0.1 and custom cutoff choices
- LLM settings and transcript review show simpler controls, with technical setup and numerical diagnostics folded away
- Markdown and exercise-deck cards made from books or videos mark target and context fields as the target language automatically
- Studio and exported word clouds are linguistic only; foreground colour is applied from the source editor

### Fixed
- Speech program and model downloads no longer fail before their progress starts
- Exported guides include the segmented-colour parser needed for independent builds
- Speech model notices list every catalogue source and converted package with its own licence
- Persian dictionary lookup recognizes colloquial copulas and combined nominal endings, with direct entries preferred and dictionary-backed stem guards

- Partial-word colours compile and remain visible in PDFs, including headings, target-language blocks and exercise prompts

## [a0.4.2] - 2026-09-30
### Added
- Glosses an LLM writes are aligned to their chunks: a meaning says what its own words say, in the text's order
- Every prompt is assembled by one kit from its instructions, its answer contract and its data, and opens with a version line
- The LLM row: one control for every prompt, saying its size before the copy, on the studio, the exercise dialog, the add page, the tidy, the player, the reader and Ask LLM
- A video's vocabulary in the books' entries, asked of the chatbots and drawn as in the reader, with macro buttons that say what they write
- A book made by an agent in place, from any device, its text given in parts, watched from the library, steered through asks, finished with one button
- Prompts of your own, from a menu at every copy button, exported and imported under Settings → Your prompts
- The studio's prompt in parts you tick, with presets, a level and a length, and the exercise dialog pre-ticking what the page uses
- Options of a prompt: the transliteration in IPA, and the short vowels of Persian and Arabic
- Every language's conventions carry a worked example and one vocabulary convention
- Skills for your chatbot: gloss, markdown and book, built on request and downloaded under Settings → Skills
- A sound in place of a video, with its waveform
- A video phrase's note can be edited, and a ✱ notes button lights every phrase that has one
- A vocabulary or opposites flashcard's example, notes and source go on the side the card turns to
- Settings → Pictograms (ARASAAC): the symbols and their words fetched on request, with their licence

### Changed
- The LLM prompt page's Edit prompt, Save custom prompt and Reset to default give way to the prompt menu

## [a0.4.1] - 2026-09-29
### Added
- Speech to text, optional and local: a transcript made on this computer while adding a video, from a film on this machine or a YouTube video recorded through the tab
- Settings → Speech to text: the program, two Whisper models and the processor, open to any device let in
- The graphics card is used only once Parseh has proved it works; the CPU always does
- A YouTube video recorded for its transcript keeps that recording's waveform when it is added
- Hover ⏸ in a book's reader, in both interfaces: the narration waits while a gloss is open
- Edit times by ear in a book's header, and a video's timings, open where the listener is

### Changed
- An update, and going back, leave the speech program and its models as they are (stt/)
- Typing in the transcript, the address or the film's path makes a prepared LLM prompt stale
- The offline page's Try again says that it tried, and Go back is a button of its own

### Fixed
- A page not kept on the device opens from a computer that is only slow, instead of "Parseh cannot be reached"
- Stopping the tab share after a waveform was drawn no longer pauses the video or resets its speed
- The transcript editor saves the draft as it hands the transcript back

## [a0.4.0] - 2026-09-28
### Added
- LaTeX drawings: a ::::latex block, or [...]{latex} inline, compiled by LaTeX itself, beside the formulas MathJax draws
- The same drawing on screen, in the PDF, in an HTML export and on a phone; a live preview kept only once it is saved
- A drawing that cannot be made shows its source and one line saying why, with the button that mends it
- The sheet that draws a block: its preview filling its pane beside the source, a caption, size and position folded away
- Settings → LaTeX drawings, styled like the rest of Settings: named themes of packages, languages, a font, a preamble and a compiler
- Themes exported and imported as files; a rename rewrites every block that names the theme
- A theme's packages beyond the base kept in Parseh's own folder, listed with the base, asked about and gotten one at a time
- More packages to pick from: syntax trees and dependency arcs, the IPA, pinyin over Chinese characters
- A deck's exercises filtered by where they came from, beside its text and tag filters
- Flashcards that are asked both ways: both (random) and both (repeat), the second two linked cards in a deck
- The transliteration cloud works on an exported page and on the guide's own words
- On a phone's video, the subtitles have a text size of their own, reached in full-screen too

### Changed
- Every Settings page starts with the bar of its doors, Network included
- Deleting a document asks in the studio's own window, and the card leaves the list at once
- Documents, decks, bundles and shelves are stored in a new shape: going back to a0.3.3 says so first
- The size sliders of books and videos reach further, at both ends

### Fixed
- Exporting a page to HTML from another device could land on "Parseh cannot be reached": it shows a bar now

## [a0.3.3] - 2026-09-25
### Added

- Estimate the rest by the sound: boundaries placed in the pauses of the waveform, in books and videos
- Update Parseh from Settings, from GitHub or a zip, to any version, keeping your content and settings
- Releases on GitHub, one zip per version; Parseh shows its version on the hub and in Settings
- Downloads show their size, progress and time left, can be stopped, and resume where they stopped
- On a phone, the dictionary opens in a sheet, and sparsely glossed books and videos mark their glossed chunks

### Changed
- Dictionaries and the other downloads moved to Settings → Reading help, laid out by language
- "Offline" only when the computer is really gone, with ↻ to check again
- Who may change a setting is decided per setting: Network and updates on the computer only
- Languages you add are kept in config/
- Exported pages open on sepia

### Fixed
- Pages of other websites could make Parseh change things
- A phone could read the Wi-Fi pairing code
- The test suites wrote into config/

## [a0.3.1] - 2026-09-24
### Changed
- Fill in the blanks and matching: a click opens the word cloud in the browser too
- Flashcards in the PDF are cards to cut out and fold
- Answering an exercise no longer copies the word to the clipboard

### Added
- On a phone, a video on the whole screen can show the captions around the one being said
- On a phone, a dictionary button in the gloss cloud

### Fixed
