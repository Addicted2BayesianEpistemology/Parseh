#   ./build.sh --html          skip LaTeX, rebuild readers and index only
#   ./build.sh --force         ignore the cache and rebuild even if unchanged

#
# Each book is a directory books/<language>/<slug>/ with a book.json, the
# language folder being the registry's (lib/languages.json: persian, arabic,
# italian, japanese -- docs/languages.md section 2).  Nothing here has a list
# of books or of languages in it: adding a directory is all it takes.  A
# book.json lying directly under books/, the layout before languages, is still
# built, as a Persian book, with a note asking for it to be moved.
#
# WHY THERE IS A CACHE.  One lualatex pass over Buf-e Kur is about eleven
# minutes -- 2500 pages, four passes of bidi shaping over every sentence -- and
# the book needs two of them.  Rebuilding a book nothing touched, or rebuilding
# the whole book to look at one paragraph, is the difference between a second
# and three quarters of an hour.  So:
#
#   * a book whose sources are unchanged is skipped outright;
#   * the second lualatex pass runs only if the first moved .aux or .toc;
#   * --draft builds only the chapters named, for looking at your own work.
#
# THE RULE THE CACHE IS WRITTEN AROUND: a false rebuild only costs time, but a
# false *skip* serves a stale PDF as if it were current, and there is nothing
# downstream that would notice.  Every judgement call here is therefore settled
# in favour of rebuilding.  Three consequences worth keeping:
#
#   * a key is recorded ONLY on a path that actually ran the tool it stands for
#     -- --html must never stamp the LaTeX key, or the next real build skips a
#     chapter that was never typeset;
#   * a key is captured BEFORE the tool runs and written after it succeeds, so
#     an edit made during the eleven minutes leaves the key stale and forces a
#     rebuild rather than being recorded as already built;
#   * a tool that fails must not have its key written, which means its exit
#     status may not be swallowed by a pipe (`| sed` hides it) or by `|| true`.
#
# The LaTeX key ignores the "% @par" timing comments, because those are
# whole-line comments that TeX eats with their newline and so cannot move a
# single page.  timestamp.py --from-sidecar is run before the keys are taken,
# so both keys describe the tree as it will be left.
#
# Both keys take in everything a build reads that is not the book's own: the
# shared preamble and front matter, every lib/lang/<code>.tex (the preamble
# inputs the book's), lib/languages.json (the preamble reads the fonts from
# it, and the reader its language record), the fonts, and lib/*.py for the
# reader.  A file left out of a key is a change that can never trigger a
# rebuild -- exactly the false skip the rule above forbids.

#     145 pages of Persian and still reported 0 errors;
#   * lualatex never running at all -- killed, or missing.  The log and the PDF
#     from the PREVIOUS run are still lying there and pass every test above.
