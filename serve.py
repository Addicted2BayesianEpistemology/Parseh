"""Parseh -- one server for the whole toolbox, over HTTPS.

    python3 serve.py                 the doors Settings has open, https on 7654
    python3 serve.py 9000            ... on another port, this once
    python3 serve.py --host 100.x.y.z    bind one address only (e.g. Tailscale)
    python3 serve.py --local         bind 127.0.0.1 only
    python3 serve.py --http          plain http, no TLS (debugging only)
    python3 serve.py --cert          (re)make the certificate and exit

Nothing above is needed to run Parseh: which doors are open, and on which
port, is a page -- /settings/network/ -- and a change there takes effect at
once, without a restart and without a command (lib/network.py keeps it in
config/network.json, lib/settingspage.py writes the page).  The arguments
are for this one run, and for the tests.

What is mounted where -- one address, one port, one process:

    /                 the hub: books, videos, studio, exercises, Anki
    /books/           the reading editions (static pages built by ./build.sh)
    /youtube/         the video player (pages assembled per request)
    /youtube/add/     paste a transcript, copy the prompt, paste the answer
    /books/add/       the recipe and the Claude Code prompt for a new edition
    /studio/          the LLM-answer studio, under a prefix
    /exercises/       decks of studio exercises, studied like Anki cards
                      (markdown/app/deckroutes.py, the store in exercises/)
    /anki/...         the card store BOTH readers write into -- shared
    /clips/...        the clip tray: recordings cut from a narration or a film or
                      recorded from a YouTube video in the tab, frames captured
                      from a video (lib/clips.py, the folder clips/); /clips/
                      itself is the page that plays and deletes them
    /lib/...          the palette, the shared script, the fonts
    /lib/langs.css    the per-language font tokens, generated from lib/languages.json
    /guide/           the guide: html-guide/'s front page and its compiled pages
                      (lib/guidebuild.py), compiled from the page's own button
    /guide.pdf        where the PDF manual was: on to /guide/, which is the manual
    /licences/        the licences: Parseh's (GPL-3.0-or-later, its text at
                      /licences/LICENSE), and those of the fonts, MathJax and
                      the data the reading help downloads (lib/notices.py)
    /settings/        the settings, from the pages: /settings/network/ is who
                      may reach this Parseh, on which port, with which
                      certificate (lib/settingspage.py, lib/network.py)
    /__shutdown       POST: stop the server (every page has a button)

WHO MAY REACH IT.  This computer always; a VPN (Tailscale's range, and
anything Settings adds) by default; the Wi-Fi only once its door is opened
AND the device has been let in with a code shown on the computer.  The range
question is asked of the connection, before a byte of HTTP (Server.
verify_request); the "let in" question is asked of the request, because the
answer is a cookie (Handler._gate).

HTTPS, with a certificate this program makes itself.  Browsers hand out
screen capture (the frame button on a card) and the clipboard only on
secure origins, and localhost is the only plain-http origin they trust --
so a phone or a laptop reaching this over Tailscale needs TLS.  Nobody but
us ever connects, so a certificate nobody else vouches for is exactly
right: each browser warns ONCE about it, you accept, and that is the end of
it.  It lives in .tls/ and is minted on first start with openssl (every
address the machine has in its SAN), signed by an authority of the
machine's own that a phone can be told to trust -- which is what installing
the mobile interface as an app needs (make_cert); `--cert` mints a fresh
server certificate under the same authority.

A plain-http request that lands on the https port (an old bookmark) is
answered with a redirect to the https address, not a handshake error.

The request body is read once, up front, and every handler sees it
through rfile -- so a POST can never be left half-read on a keep-alive
connection, whichever of the three route sets answers it.  HTTP Range is
honoured on every file, which is what lets the narration be seeked.

Two kinds of noise are deliberately swallowed, because both are ordinary
here and neither is a fault: a client that goes away mid-transfer (seeking
in a 218 MB narration aborts the range request in flight, several times a
minute), and a TLS probe or an abandoned handshake.  Anything else still
prints its traceback: a real bug in a handler should not be silent.

def notes_to_keep(content_dir):
    """The notes beside this book or this video, as lib/offline.py wants them.

    THIS LOOKUP IS HERE AND NOT THERE, and that is the point of it.  A note is
    a studio document: which notes there are, and what each one renders to, is
    the studio's own knowledge (store.list_docs, htmlgen.render_document), and
    lib/offline.py must not import the studio -- lib/ is what a reader, a
    bundle and the launcher lean on, and none of them has a studio.  This
    module is the one place that holds both, so this module looks and hands
    the answer over; offline.notes_group turns it into addresses and sizes.

    WHY A NOTE IS RENDERED TO ANSWER THIS.  Whether a note holds an exercise
    is asked of the RENDER and not of the markdown, exactly as page_note asks
    it -- only the render knows what a block became, and a malformed exercise
    block is still an exercise box on the page.  Getting that wrong would keep
    a bare page for a note that redirects to the document page, so the phone
    would hold a note it cannot open.  The same render says whether there is a
    formula in it (the `class="math"` every renderer writes), which is what
    decides whether the two megabytes of MathJax are kept.

    AND WHY IT IS RENDERED ONCE AND NOT AGAIN.  This door is not asked only
    when somebody presses *Keep on this phone*: lib/keep.js asks it a second
    and a half after every open of a kept book, to see whether what the phone
    holds has gone stale.  Rendering forty notes on every open of a book is
    reading the whole book to answer a question about keeping, which is the
    one thing docs/mobile.md says this must never cost.  So each note's two
    flags are remembered against its `updated` stamp, and the render is
    skipped while the stamp stands.

    THE STAMP IS THE RIGHT KEY because it is the same one the rest of this
    work stamps a note by: offline.notes_group puts `updated` into the book's
    version and offline.document puts it into the document's, so a note whose
    stamp has not moved is a note the phone is already holding the right bytes
    for -- and a note written or edited later moves the stamp, which both
    refreshes the marks and sends this render round again (decision 7).  The
    library is part of the key as well, because two books' notes are two
    stores and an id is only unique inside one.

    A render that THREW is not remembered.  The failure may be the note's or
    it may be the moment's, and a note that could not be read once should not
    be written off as plain until somebody edits it; it costs one render per
    ask, for a note nobody has managed to break yet.

    The library is pointed at this content's own notes for the length of the
    call and put back in the `finally`, as `_notes` does, so nothing can leave
    this thread reading somebody's book.

# ONE RUNNER FOR THE FIVE KINDS.  A dictionary, a component pack, a corpus, a
# translation model and the synonym table used to be started by five copies
# of the same thread, each reporting one sentence.  Now each job also says
# how far it has got -- `done` of `total` bytes, in its `phase` ("download",
# then "build") -- so the page can draw a bar that moves and say the time
# left; each can be STOPPED (a threading.Event the downloader asks between
# blocks, lib/download.py), which keeps what was fetched for the next press;
# and none starts without first being asked what it costs and whether the
# disk has the room.  The downloaders' own interface: build(..., say=,
# progress=, cancel=) and plan(...), for the same arguments.
#
# The job tables above keep their shapes and their keys -- the activity list,
# the old status routes and the tests read them -- and each job gains:

    def _lookup(self, code, body=None, gloss="en"):
        """What a dictionary has to say about the words of one chunk.

        Read-only, in every sense: it opens the language's dict/<code>.db
        read-only, it writes nothing anywhere, and what it answers is marked
        in both readers as a dictionary and not as a gloss.  NOTHING IN THE
        READING PANEL TURNS AN ENTRY INTO A GLOSS -- there has been no `use`
        button there for a while.  That happens only in the chunk editor,
        whose sources column (the book's #chside, the player's .eside) has a
        button per hit that puts an entry into the edit box and nothing more:
        a \\dw, or for a verb the \\vb below.  Nothing is written until the
        chunk is saved, down the ordinary edit route with the ordinary
        checkers on it, like any other edit.

        A VERB HIT CARRIES ITS \\vb (`hit["vb"]`), built by lib/verbs from the
        dictionary's own conjugation table wherever the language has a
        recipe: TeX for a book's vocabulary line, plain text for a video's, a
        short line for the panel.  Both routes come through here -- the
        book's `__lookup` and the player's /youtube/api/lookup -- so both
        readers get it from this one call.  It is an extra on the answer and
        never a condition of it: a failure is told on stderr once per
        language and the words go back without it.  `gloss` goes with it
        because Wiktionary's senses are English, and a book glossed in
        another language is given a \\vb with no meaning in it rather than an
        English one.

        Two shapes of question, because a page has to know whether to draw
        the button before it has anything to look up:

            {"about": 1}          what is installed for this language
            {"text": "..."}       and what does it say about this chunk
            {"text", "words"}     ... divided where the chunk's word line
                                  divides it, one row per word, `i` its
                                  place among the line's words
            {"text", "senses": "all"}
                                  ... with every sense of each hit, the
                                  ones past the first three as `more`

        THREE THINGS, INDEPENDENTLY.  The dictionary and the parallel corpus
        are separate downloads and either can be here without the other, so
        each is reported and each is asked separately.  This used to consult
        the corpus only where a dictionary was installed and to gate the whole
        panel on the dictionary alone -- which meant a language with a corpus
        and no dictionary had a corpus it could not reach.  (The third, the
        translation model, is not the server's to report: it is files under
        mt/ that the reader fetches itself.)

        `available: false` is a perfectly good answer and not an error: a
        language with none of them is read exactly as it is read today.
