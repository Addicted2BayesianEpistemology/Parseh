/* The Frank-method video player.
 *
 * Renders videos/<folder>/<id>/annotations.json under the embedded YouTube
 * video, one block per caption.  Each block is split into the annotator's
 * phrases; hovering a phrase opens the gloss cloud — the reading (kana)
 * where the language has one, transliteration, vocabulary, meaning — set
 * exactly like a gloss block in the reading editions.  The caption whose
 * time the video is inside is highlighted and followed.
 *
 * A phrase is also WRITTEN from that cloud: four colours to mark it with,
 * the same four the reading editions use, and a ✎ that opens the chunk's
 * own fields.  Both POST to /youtube/api/edit, which puts the edit through
 * check_annotations before anything is written and refuses it in the
 * checker's own words -- and those words are what the cloud shows.
 *
 * Everything the script knows about the LANGUAGE comes from CFG.lang, the
 * registry record (lib/languages.json) the server embedded in the page:
 * its direction, its character class (for isolating runs of the script
 * inside a gloss, and for telling target text from a bare run of
 * something else), its word separator (a Japanese chunk is one word), its
 * name for the labels, its Anki tag.  No script, digit or font is named
 * in this file.
 *
 * A video declares a second language, CFG.gloss: the one its meanings are
 * WRITTEN in (video.json's "gloss"; absent means English, which is what
 * every video written before the field existed means).  It is a prose
 * language and need not be one the toolbox teaches -- Persian glossed in
 * Spanish -- so its record carries only what a page asks of it: a name, a
 * direction, and whether the registry knows it too.  Everything on the
 * page that is PROSE rather than target text takes it: the meaning, the
 * vocabulary line, the note, and the labels over them.

  /* One dictionary hit, as a row with the buttons that put it somewhere.
     A VERB IS OFFERED AS A VERB.  Where the language's recipe recognised the
     hit (hit.vb, lib/verbs/), the vocabulary entry is the one a person
     writes for a verb -- the form in the phrase, then the lemma with its
     other forms: "آمده āmade come (آمدن āmadan · pres. آ ā · past آمد āmad
     · to come)", as this video's own annotations write آمده -- and the row
     shows those forms under the headword, so what the button will put is
     read before it is pressed.  The recipe says when it could not fill
     something the language needs (a stem nobody romanised); the button then
     says what, and so does the row, rather than the line going in looking
     finished.  Anything else is the plain headword, its sound, a sense.

     WHAT GOES IN IS NAMED WHEN IT IS NOT THE HEADWORD.  German puts a
     separated verb back together: "stand … auf" is looked up as stand,
     reaches stehen, and the recipe hands back aufstehen's \vb -- whose line,
     "pret. stand auf · p.p. aufgestanden", sat under "stehen" unexplained.
     A reflexive does the same (freuen gives sich freuen), and a Persian
     compound (فکر کردن gives its light verb کردن, the noun left to a \bw).
     So the row says "stehen → aufstehen": the arrow is "what the vocabulary
     gets" when that is ANOTHER word than the one heading the row.

     THE ROW IS HEADED AS THE CAPTION SPELLS IT, as the book's is (sideHit):
     h.spelled, 睡觉 where Wiktionary files the entry under 睡覺, with the
     dictionary's headword in the title.  It used to be headed by the
     headword and point at the spelling -- and a verb's lemma is written the
     way the video writes it, so the real 睡觉 hit (dict/zh.db) read
     "睡覺 → 睡觉", one word pointing at itself.  Compared folded
     (wordKey), as the book compares, because Arabic did the same with its
     marks: "وصل → وَصَلَ", the bare page title and the vowelled \vb of one
     verb. */

  /* ---------- deleting a gloss, and taking the delete back ----------------
     DELETE GLOSS empties the gloss's own boxes -- the reading where the
     language has one, the transliteration, the vocabulary, the meaning --
     through the very door a save goes through (/youtube/api/edit), and
     nothing else: the text, the colour, the word line, the note and the
     transcript mark stay, and the chunk is one nobody has glossed yet, which
     is legal in every video.  One click and no question, because the undo is
     right there: the old gloss is kept IN THE PAGE (never in storage) until
     the page is reloaded, and UNDO DELETE writes it back through the same
     door -- filling boxes is always allowed.  Reopening the form on the chunk
     later offers the undo again.

     The memory is keyed by the chunk's place AND its text: a cut or a join
     renumbers the phrases of a caption, and a gloss must never be written
     back onto whichever phrase has moved into the deleted one's place.  An
     emptied chunk is also what an LLM is asked to fill (the region panel

  /* ---------------- notes: what the transcript has no room for ----------
     The same thing the book reader has, in the same shape and against the
     same server: a markdown file in the seam between two captions, kept in
     the video's own folder under markdown/, written with the studio's
     editor and read in a frame over the page.  Never inline -- the
     transcript is the point -- and never in a prompt: a note is somebody's
     own reading, and a model has nothing to put in one.

     A note is anchored to a caption's START, which is what transcript.txt
     is keyed by and what survives a re-merge and a re-chunk.  One that
     names a start no longer in the video is shown at the end, marked
     adrift, rather than dropped. */

  /* ---------- the bare note page, and the notes read ahead --------------
     What a mark opens is the studio's BARE note page (its templates/
     note.html): the rendered note on the studio's own sheet, with no editor
     and none of its scripts.  The document page it used to open is about
     1.3 MB fetched afresh every time, for something read a dozen times in a
     session and written on almost never; "open in the studio", in the bare
     page's own header, is one click from the whole of it.

     And a note whose mark comes near the window is read BEFORE it is asked
     for, so that the click costs nothing -- the same bargain the reader
     makes.  It is held as text and put into the frame with srcdoc, not left
     to the browser's cache, because the studio answers `no-cache` for
     everything it renders (a page somebody may be editing must never come
     back stale) and a revalidation over a tunnel is the very wait this is
     here to remove.  Capped, because a long video has a great many notes
     and a viewer walking it would otherwise carry all of them; never while
     a note is open, because the note being read is what the connection is
     for; and never for one that holds an exercise, which the server answers
     with a redirect to the studio's full page (an exercise with no script
     is a box that cannot be answered), remembered here so the next click
     goes straight there.

     AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER THERE IS NO REDIRECT TO SEE.  A kept video keeps
     its notes, and for a note that holds an exercise what was kept IS the
     studio's full page, so it can be answered on a train exactly as it is at
     the desk (TO-DO §0, "the notes, kept with their book or video").  The
     worker hands that page back at the bare address without a hop, and
     `redirected` is false: a test that believed it would put a document
     page, scripts and all, into the frame through srcdoc.  So the page is
     asked what it is as well.  The studio writes that on its own <body> --
     `data-page="doc"` on the document page, `data-page="note"` on the bare
     one -- which is honest whoever gave the answer, and which a note's own
     text cannot forge: everything it contributes went through the
     renderer's escaping. */

  /* ---------- a note, before it is opened ---------------------------------
     A mark is a title in a pill, cut at 52 characters, and the only way to
     know what a note says was to open it: a frame over the whole page, the
     video paused, Esc to come back.  So a pointer resting on a mark shows a
     small card of what is in it -- the title whole, the opening of the text,
     and what a click will do -- and leaves the moment the pointer does.
     The text is notes.index()'s `excerpt`, which rides on the /api/marks
     answer loadNotes already fetches (front matter, anchor and markup taken
     out, about 280 characters), so a preview costs no request; a server
     from before that field gives the title and the invitation alone.

     TEXT, NEVER MARKUP.  A note can be somebody else's -- they travel inside
     video bundles -- and a preview is involuntary: it happens to whoever's
     pointer crosses the seam.  Clicking a note has always meant choosing to
     run it in the frame; resting on one must not.  So every word of it goes
     in by textContent and nothing here is ever innerHTML.

     Only where there is a hover (HOVER_OK): a touch screen's tap already
     opens the note, and a preview flashed on the way would be noise.  It is
     never in the way: pointer-events none, below the sheets and the note's
     own frame, and gone on leave, blur, Escape, a click, and any scroll --
     the follow mode scrolls the transcript on every caption, and a fixed
     card left behind would point at a different seam. */

  /* ---------------- where a chunk ends ----------------
     A chunk is a sense group, and the groups an LLM cut on its first pass
     are the first thing somebody who knows the language wants to move.
     Two operations, in a sheet of its own above the cloud:

       JOIN this phrase to the one after it (or, from the second phrase on,
       the one before it to this one -- so a run left unglossed, which has
       no cloud of its own, is still reachable from either side).  The texts
       go end to end with the language's word separator, so the caption is
       reproduced character for character and the fidelity check cannot
       fail; the romanisation and the meaning are joined with a space and
       the vocabulary with its own middle dot, and the server names in a
       note whatever could not simply be run together.

       CUT it in two, at one of the places the text divides: a space for a
       language written with spaces, and any two characters for Japanese,
       which writes none.  What goes to which half is a judgement, and this
       is where it is made -- the vocabulary entries arrive on the side
       whose text holds their headword and cross over with an arrow, every
       box is typed over freely, and nothing is written until the button.

     The proposals come from the server (lib/chunkdiv.py), which is also
     what the book reader's sheet draws: one set of rules, shown twice.

     AFTERWARDS the caption's chunks have been renumbered, and the page is
     redrawn from the list the server sends back -- not patched, because
     every phrase after the change has moved and every closure in the
     caption would be one out.  A page left open is safe too: each divide
     sends the text it is looking at, and the server refuses when the file
     no longer says that. */

  /* -- capturing a frame.  THERE ARE TWO WAYS, and which one is used depends
     on where the picture is, not on the browser (the owner's choice,
     2026-09-23).

     A FILM ON THIS MACHINE is a <video> of this very page, served from this
     very origin: a canvas reads its pixels outright.  No sharing question, no
     calibration dots, no rolling in muted past an overlay that is not there,
     and -- the point -- it works on a phone, where no browser shares a tab at
     all.  Until today every capture went the long way round, so the button on
     a phone answered "capture needs a secure page", which was never the
     reason (TO-DO §2.18).

     A YOUTUBE VIDEO is behind a cross-origin iframe and its pixels can only
     come from a display capture, which is a computer's affair.  On a phone
     the button says so plainly instead of blaming the address.

     Everything below is that second way, and all of it exists to hand back
     the VIDEO'S OWN frame, never a page screenshot:
       . Chrome, "This Tab": Region Capture crops the stream to the video
         element itself; older Chromium falls back to viewport arithmetic.
       . Firefox -- and any window or screen share: the page flashes two
         coloured dots on the video's corners, finds them in the captured
         frame, and derives the exact pixel mapping.  Toolbars, zoom, DPR
         and window position all cancel out of that equation.
     Standards only; nothing depends on YouTube's internals staying still.
     A PAUSED embed shows YouTube's controls, and they linger for a full
     FIVE seconds once playback starts -- so the capture seeks ~5s before
     the moment and rolls in muted: the overlay has just faded when the
     wanted frame goes by, and the player freezes back on it. -- */
  /* -- SHARING THIS TAB.  One share, asked for once, serves the frame
     capture (its pictures) and the cut editor on a YouTube video (its sound,

     with its sound wherever the browser can record that (Chrome, Edge); a
     share given without the sound still serves the pictures, and the sound

  /* THE TIMINGS: where each caption starts, moved over a picture of the
     sound.  The add page's transcript editor does this BEFORE a video is
     added and writes nothing to disk; this is the one door that does it
     afterwards, and youtube/lib/captimes.py says at length why moving a
     start is allowed where moving a caption's words is not.

     A caption has a start and nothing else -- the one before it runs until
     that start -- so there is one number per boundary and nothing to split,
     which is what `kind: point` means to the timeline.

     THE PICTURE OF THE SOUND, three ways.  A film on this machine has one
     for nothing: the server reads it with ffmpeg, window by window, as it
     does for a book (/youtube/api/peaks).  A YouTube video has no file
     anybody here can read, so it has no waveform unless somebody asks for
     one, and asking means recording the whole video as this tab plays it --
     which is why it is offered and never assumed.  What is kept from that
     recording is the SHAPE and not the sound: peaks every 50 ms, a few
     hundred kilobytes for an hour, written beside the video as
     waveform.json and read back by every later visit.  Nothing needs the
     audio itself, because the player can play any second of the video on

  /* RECORDING THE SHAPE OF A YOUTUBE VIDEO'S SOUND.

     hundred kilobytes for an hour where the sound itself would be hundreds
     of megabytes -- too big for the upload ceiling, too big to hold in the

     needs the audio: the player can play any second of the video itself.

     EACH NUMBER IS FILED UNDER THE VIDEO'S OWN CLOCK, not under how long
     the recording has been running.  That is the whole trick: if the video
     stops to buffer, the clock stops with it, and what was heard goes on
     being filed where it belongs instead of sliding everything after it.
     The card kit's own recorder cannot do that -- it is cutting a clip, and

  /* ---------------- glossing a stretch with an LLM ----------------
     A run of captions, picked on the transcript, sent to an LLM as a prompt
     and filled from its answer -- the book reader's region sheet, for a
     video.  Everything that matters is decided by the server
     (lib/glossregion.py): which chunks the prompt asks to be glossed, and,
     when the answer comes back, which of them it may write.  The page only
     says which captions and how, and shows what the server did.

     PICKED ON THE TRANSCRIPT ITSELF.  While the panel is open a click on a
     caption -- its time, its text, any phrase of it -- picks it instead of
     playing it: the first sets "from", the second "to" (the two swapped if
     the second is the earlier), and a third starts again.  The run is lit on
     the transcript and each end is named in its slot by its number and its
     time.  The number is the caption's place among ALL the captions, plain
     ones included -- the numbering /youtube/api/edit and the editor's
     "segment N" use, and the one the server's own region words print -- so
     a plain caption can be an end, and inside the run it is sent as context
     and never glossed.  With "to" not picked the stretch is the one caption.

     THE TWO BOXES ARE READ WHEN THEY ARE USED: copying sends their state to
     make the prompt, and filling sends their state AT THAT MOMENT -- the
     state when you paste decides what may be replaced, whatever it was when
     the prompt was made (the owner's rule, D12).  A re-gloss that would
     replace a gloss writes nothing the first time: the button asks again,
     armed, and a second press within four seconds (the reader's two-press
     arm) says yes.

     WHAT THE ANSWER WROTE IS DRAWN AGAIN IN PLACE.  The server hands back
     every caption it wrote to, whole; each replaces its entry in `segs` and
     its line is swapped for a new one where it stands (redrawSeg) -- the
     video, the scroll, the on-air line, the other captions, the answer box
     and the undo memory all stay as they were, which a reload would lose. */
