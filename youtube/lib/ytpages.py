"""The video player's pages and endpoints, as functions the Parseh server calls.

This used to be youtube/serve.py, a server of its own on port 8770.  Since
the whole toolbox is served by ../../serve.py under one https address, the
player lives at BASE (= /youtube) and this module only *assembles* things:
the channel index, a channel's page, a video's player page, and the Anki
endpoints both readers share (the store itself is lib/anki_store.py).

Every function that answers a request takes the handler `h`, which offers
send_html / send_json / send_bytes, the pre-read request body in h._raw,
and the parsed query string in h.query -- the same small interface the
studio's route functions use, so one server can drive all three.

Pages are assembled per request from the directories under videos/:
drop a new  videos/<folder>/<id>/  (the folder is the language's, from
lib/languages.json: persian, japanese, ...) with a video.json and an
annotations.json and it appears on the index, with no build step and no
restart.  The index groups channels by language; a video's URL carries only
its id (/youtube/v/<id>/), since ids are unique across languages, and the
player page is told which folder to fetch from.
