"""An automatic transcript, cut into sentences and timed again.

    tidy.tidy(captions, "fa")      -> (captions, notes)

WHAT IS WRONG WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPT.  YouTube cuts its captions
where it runs out of room, never where a sentence ends, and it prints no
punctuation at all.  So one caption holds the end of a sentence and the
start of the next, a sentence runs across three of them, and the reader --
and the model that is about to gloss it -- gets no help from the shape of
the text.  The times are not wrong, they are just nailed to the wrong
places.

WHAT THIS DOES ABOUT IT, and it is a guess and says so:

  1  EVERY WORD GETS A TIME.  A caption runs until the next one begins, and
     its words are laid across that stretch in proportion to how long each
     one IS -- the same first guess lib/timestamp.py's `spread` makes for a
     book's narration, and the same measure (the marks stripped, the spaces
     out).  A language written without spaces is laid out character by
     character, which is what lib/timestamp.py does for such a book too.
     Nothing here pretends that is where the word was spoken; it is where it
     probably was, and a tenth of a second either way is what the editor's
     buttons are for.
  2  THE PUNCTUATION THE TRANSCRIPT ALREADY CARRIES IS THE FIRST CUE, and
     for most languages it is nearly the whole job.  YouTube punctuates its
     automatic captions for English, Italian, French, German, Spanish,
     Japanese -- it is Persian and Arabic it leaves bare -- and a full stop
     is a sentence end wherever a language prints one.  What this adds is
     cutting at them ACROSS the caption edges, which is the one thing the
     transcript cannot do for itself.  (Read by _stops and not by
     lib/draft.py's `sentences`: that reads prose, where a lower-case letter
     after a stop proves an abbreviation, and an automatic transcript is
     written in one case throughout.  Its other guard is kept.)
  3  THE VERB ENDS THE SENTENCE where the language puts it last and nothing
     is punctuated -- Persian, Turkish (chunker.verb_final).  lib/chunker.py
     already knows which words those are: its function-word lists give the
     copulas ("است", "نیست", "هستم") and the installed dictionary gives the
     verbs ("دارد", "می‌گوید").  This is the cue that does the work where
     cue 2 finds nothing at all.
  4  A PAUSE IS A FULL STOP TOO, where the words give no other cue.  The
     caption edges carry that much: a caption whose words are laid across
     far more time than its length asks for was a caption with silence in
     it, and silence after a run of words is where the sentence ended.  It
     is the one thing here that is heard rather than read, and it is what
     turns "باردار باردار یعنی چه" back into three captions.
  5  A NON-SPEECH TAG STANDS ALONE.  "[موسیقی]", "[گریان]": whoever reads
     the transcript wants them where they happened and not glued to a
     sentence, and the glosser wants them out of its way.  They are kept --
     nothing here deletes a word -- but they are their own caption.
  6  EACH SENTENCE BECOMES ONE CAPTION, starting at the time of its first
     word, and ending with a full stop -- or the language's question mark
     where the sentence opens with one of its question words.
  7  NOTHING IS ADDED AND NOTHING IS LOST.  The words that come out are the
     words that went in, in order; only the punctuation is new.  That is
     checked here (`_same_words`), and a tidy that cannot promise it gives
     the captions back untouched rather than a transcript nobody wrote.

EVERY LANGUAGE THE TOOLBOX TEACHES GETS THIS, because every one of them
gives at least one of those cues: the punctuated ones give the first, the
verb-final ones the third, and the pause and the tags belong to all of them.
What differs is how much each cue is worth there, not whether the button
exists.

WHAT GATES IT IS THE DICTIONARY, and nothing else.  Not because a full stop
needs one, but because everything this does ABOVE a full stop is a question
about a word -- is it a verb, is it a name -- and that is what a dictionary
answers.  Without one the button is there and disabled, saying which
dictionary to install; install it and it works, with no reload
(can_tidy, why_not).

WHAT IT CANNOT DO.  It cannot hear the video, so a word YouTube misheard is
still misheard, and it cannot know that a pause was a full stop where
nothing else says so.  It is a BUTTON and never a rule: the editor shows
what it made and keeps the way back.

the next, and a sentence may run across three of them.%(bare)s The times are not
wrong -- each caption really does begin when it says -- they are just nailed to
the wrong places.

shape and with nothing else around it:

```
0:08
%(example)s
0:11.5

A line with a time on it, then the sentence, then the next time, and so on. A
time is M:SS or H:MM:SS, and may carry one decimal (0:11.5) where a sentence
begins between two seconds. Every caption's time must be LATER than the one
before it.

THE RULES, in the order they matter:

1. KEEP THE WORDS. This is a transcript of what somebody said, and the whole
   video will be glossed against it. Do not summarise, do not tidy the grammar,
   do not drop a repetition -- a teacher saying "%(rep)s" said it three times
   and the transcript says so too.
2. CUT AT SENTENCES. Join what the captions split and split what they ran
   together. One sentence per caption; a very long sentence may be two captions
   cut at a clause.
3. PUNCTUATE. Full stops, question marks, commas where they help a reader.
   %(marks)s
4. TIME EACH CAPTION at the moment its first word is spoken. Work it out from
   the times you were given: a caption's words are spread across the stretch
   from its own time to the next one's, so a sentence starting halfway through
   a caption starts about halfway through that stretch. One decimal is enough.
5. WHERE A WORD IS PLAINLY MISHEARD you may correct it -- an automatic
   transcript mishears names and runs words together -- but only where you are
   sure, and never to change what was said.
6. LEAVE THE TAGS. "[music]", "[laughter]" and the like stay where they are, on
   a line of their own where the transcript put them on one.

Give back the whole transcript in one fenced block and nothing else: no
commentary, no numbering, no translation.
