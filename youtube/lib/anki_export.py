"""Build an Anki .apkg from a deck directory under anki/.

    python3 lib/anki_export.py anki/<folder>/<deck-slug> [out.apkg]

A deck directory is what the player's card dashboard writes, filed under
its language's folder (docs/languages.md section 2):

    anki/<folder>/<slug>/deck.json          {"name": …, "lang": "fa", "id": …}
    anki/<folder>/<slug>/cards/<id>.json    one card per file -- the ground truth
    anki/<folder>/<slug>/media/<id>-*.jpg   the screenshots those cards reference
    anki/<folder>/<slug>/media/<id>-*-audio.<ext>   and their recordings

The directory carries the language, so build_deck takes the path and asks
nothing else; the package it writes is anki/build/<folder>-<slug>.apkg,
named after both because two languages may hold a deck of the same name.
A deck lying directly under anki/ is the layout from before languages and
still builds, its cards read as Persian unless they say otherwise.

The .apkg is the legacy schema-11 package (a zip holding a small SQLite
collection plus numbered media files) that every Anki since 2.1 imports.
Each note's GUID is fixed at the moment the card is saved, so re-importing
a rebuilt deck UPDATES the existing notes instead of duplicating them:
edit a card's JSON, rebuild, re-import, and the note follows.  (Deleting
a card's JSON removes it from future builds, but Anki never deletes notes
on import -- prune those in Anki itself.)  The flip side: an import also
OVERWRITES fields edited inside Anki, so if the deck has been edited
there, pull those edits home first with lib/sync_apkg.py, then rebuild.
Cards marked anki-owned by that sync are left out of the build entirely.

Note types, one pair per language (docs/languages.md section 4).  A card
says which language it is in (`lang`, a registry code; absent means
Persian, the toolbox's first language) and which kind it is (`vocab` or
`opposites`), and the pair picks the note type.  Persian's two are the
historical ones -- "Frank YouTube Persian": Persian / Transliteration /
English / Context / Notes / FrontImage / BackImage / Source / Reverse /
ReverseOnly, and "Frank Persian Opposites" -- and their ids, names,
fields and templates are kept byte for byte, because a note type's shape
can never change once notes have been studied with it (anki/README.md).
Every other language gets a pair of its own from the registry's `anki`
record: the same fields with the text field named after the language
("Japanese"), plus a Reading field (and OppositeReading) for a language
with a kana-like reading.  MODELS below is the one table of them all;
import_apkg, sync_apkg, notetypes and check_shape read it.

Template 1 asks <language> -> the meaning; template 2 asks the meaning ->
<language> and exists only while the Reverse field is non-empty (the
bidirectional checkbox).  The language's bundled web face rides along in
the package when it has one (Vazirmatn for Persian, Noto Naskh Arabic
for Arabic), so the cards wear the same face as the reader; a language
that bundles none relies on the device's own fonts.

THE MEANING IS NOT NECESSARILY ENGLISH.  The field is called "English"
and always will be -- a note type's field list is half of what Anki
matches it by, so renaming it would fork a second note type in every
collection that holds the old one -- but what is IN it is written in the
card's gloss language (`gloss`, a code languages.gloss accepts; absent
means English, which is what every card made before the field existed
means).  What that changes is the TEMPLATE and the stylesheet, which
Anki does update in place on import: the divs holding the meaning and
the notes carry that language's lang and dir, so an Italian meaning
hyphenates as Italian and an Arabic one runs right to left.  With an
English gloss every note type comes out byte for byte what it always
was.
