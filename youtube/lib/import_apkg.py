"""Reverse-import a real .apkg back into the anki/ deck store.

    python3 lib/import_apkg.py "anki/Persian CI.apkg"

Why this exists: the store's own tools (anki_export.py) only go JSON ->
.apkg.  If a deck built here gets imported into Anki, studied, maybe
renamed or moved to a nested deck, and the .apkg folder is reset or the
device changes, the LIVE state of the deck is now inside Anki, not in
this repo -- and the repo needs to catch back up, under the same name
and the same Anki deck id, so that a card added from either website
lands in the deck the person is actually reviewing rather than spawning
a second, disconnected one.

It reads a modern Anki export (the "colpkg" format: a zstd-compressed
schema-18 SQLite database in collection.anki21b, with collection.anki2
as an inert compatibility stub), an Anki 2.1 export (a plain schema-11
collection.anki21 beside the same kind of stub), and a legacy schema-11
collection.anki2, and writes each note as a card JSON in the same shape
the dashboards save -- GUID preserved exactly, so re-exporting after
this import and re-importing into Anki updates the same notes rather
than duplicating them.

Only notes belonging to THIS project's own note types (the per-language
pairs in anki_export.MODELS) are converted -- a note of any other type
(a stock Basic card, say) is left untouched and reported, since guessing
at an unfamiliar field layout risks writing garbage.  Bring those over
by hand, or ask for the mapping to be taught.  The note type says which
language a card is in, so an imported card carries `lang` (and, for a
language with a reading, `kana` / `opp_kana` from the Reading fields).

Standard library plus the `zstandard` package (for the modern format
only; a legacy-only .apkg needs nothing extra).

This is the BOOTSTRAP tool, for a deck the store has never held.  For a
deck already in the store, use lib/sync_apkg.py instead: it matches notes
to existing cards by guid whatever their filenames, where re-running this
importer would write a second apkg-<guid> file beside any card the
dashboards created and so duplicate its note on the next build.

It is also how a package BUILT by this toolbox comes in -- the .apkg the
build button makes, from your other computer or from someone else who
made the cards with Parseh:

    python3 lib/import_apkg.py "shared.apkg"            # decks not held yet
    python3 lib/import_apkg.py "shared.apkg" --merge    # and the new cards of held ones

Such a package cannot be SYNCED (it says nothing about what Anki holds,
see sync_apkg.py), but it can be brought in: a deck the store lacks is
created, and with --merge a deck already held is given the cards it
lacks.  Its cards are filed as pkg-<guid>.json -- a name that, unlike
apkg-<guid>.json, is NOT taken as Anki's word that the note exists --
so that a later genuine export lacking them reads as "not in Anki yet",
never as a deletion.  Images travel with it.

    `only_dids` restricts the work to those Anki deck ids -- the wizard's

    beside every card of decks the store already holds, leaving two files
    per note.  A deck the store already holds is skipped for the same
    reason (this is the bootstrap tool; sync_apkg.py updates a deck
    already here) -- unless `merge_held`, in which case it is given the
    cards it lacks and nothing else: the ordinary case for a package
    someone shares again after adding to it.

    Every image and recording a card names is copied out of the package
    into the deck's media/; one the package does not carry is reported.  A note carrying
    formatting the store cannot hold (HTML typed inside Anki) comes in as
    an anki-owned mirror, exactly as the sync would treat it, so that a
