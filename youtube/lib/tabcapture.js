/* Parseh — ONE capture of the sound of this tab, shared by everything that wants it.

   A YouTube video's sound reaches no script: its frame belongs to another
   site.  The only way to hear it is to record the TAB while the video plays,
   which Chrome and Edge allow (getDisplayMedia, asked for once, with the
   tab's sound).  This file is that recording and nothing else -- no page, no
   button, no fetch, no toast -- so the two pages that need it stand on the same
   code instead of each keeping a recorder of its own:

     . the video's player draws the SHAPE of the sound (the timings sheet's
       "draw the sound", youtube/lib/player.js), and
     . the add page turns the same recording into a transcript, by sending the
       sound to the computer Parseh runs on.

     ParsehTabCapture.capability(opts)  -> {ok, why}     why not, in words
     ParsehTabCapture.problem(opts)     -> '' | why      the same, as a string
     ParsehTabCapture.share(want)       -> Promise<MediaStream>   THE getDisplayMedia call
     ParsehTabCapture.share.live(want)  -> MediaStream | null     the share as it stands
     ParsehTabCapture.release()         let the share go (stop its tracks)
     ParsehTabCapture.busy()            -> bool: a recording is under way in this page
     ParsehTabCapture.record(opts)      -> {promise, cancel(), state}
     ParsehTabCapture.embed(el, id, on) -> Promise<YT.Player>  a YouTube player to record

                 picture as soon as it is granted, so that the browser does not
                 compose the tab for an hour for nothing; the sound goes on (driven:
                 tests/youtube_capture.mjs, ten seconds of it -- an hour is not)

                                     its first, in order; a Promise it returns is
                                     waited for before the next chunk is handed on,
                                     and `signal` aborts when the recording is over
                                     without having completed (cancelled, failed)
     onMark(frame, videoSeconds)     where the video was, at sample `frame` of the
                                     sound -- see MARKS below
     onEnd(reason)                   once, when everything is cleaned up: 'ended'
                                     (the video reached its end: its clock did, or
                                     its player said "ended"), 'stalled' (its clock
                                     stopped for ten seconds, and not at its end),
                                     'share-ended' (the person stopped sharing),
                                     'cancelled', 'ad', 'error'
   The promise resolves for ended, stalled and cancelled with {reason, rate,
   peaks (with wave), samples (with pcm), reached, duration}, and rejects with an
   Error whose message says what to do for the rest (its .reason is the reason).

   embed(el, id, on): on = {onReady(player), onState(code), onError(code, words),
   lengthWait: 2500, timeout: 25000} -- a frame of YouTube's is put in `el` (it
   must be on screen, and not display:none), and the promise is kept when the
   player is ready and knows how long the video is (or, after lengthWait ms, when it
   is ready and does not: a record() of it then says so).

   TWO CONSUMERS, ONE SHARE, ONE CLOCK.  The share is asked for once.  Every 25 ms
   one loop reads the video's clock once and feeds both:
     1. THE SHAPE.  An Analyser in an AudioContext of the browser's own rate reads
        the tab's sound; the loudest sample of what it holds is filed under
        round(clock * 20) -- THE VIDEO'S CLOCK, not the recording's, so that a
        video that stops to buffer does not slide what follows -- and the whole is
        divided by its loudest and kept to three decimals.  Bit for bit what
        player.js did before this file existed (tests/youtube_capture.mjs section
        l plays the ticks itself and holds it to a checksum).
     2. THE SOUND.  An AudioWorklet in a SECOND AudioContext of 16 kHz, on a
        clone of the audio track, hands blocks of 16-bit samples to the page; they
        are cut into chunks of chunkSeconds and given to onChunk one at a time.  A
        second context on purpose: the Analyser at 16 kHz would look at 128 ms of
        sound instead of 43 and every number of the shape would change.

   MARKS.  The sound is in RECORDING time and a transcript has to be in the
   VIDEO's: they differ by the start (the clock waits for YouTube to say it is
   playing) and by every stop to buffer (the tab records silence while the clock
   stands still).  So the clock and the sound are paired: onMark(frame, seconds)
   says "at sample `frame` of the sound, the video's clock read `seconds`".  One
   mark when the sound begins; one whenever the clock has strayed 0.05 s from where
   the last mark says it should be (no oftener than every 0.2 s); one at least
   every 30 s.  Nothing is guessed here: the caller (the server's remap) lays its
   captions through them.  Measured (tests/youtube_capture.mjs, Chrome 151 on
   Linux, a video of tones): laid through the marks, a tone is where the video has it
   to within 0.04 s once the video is playing, and to within 0.1 s in the first
   moments, before the clock has told how late it started.

   WHAT IS ALWAYS TRUE (tests/youtube_capture.mjs holds each):
     . one getDisplayMedia call per share, none if a live share with sound is held
     . a share with no sound fails BEFORE the video plays, in a sentence
     . nothing is ever connected to the speakers, and the microphone is never asked
     . the 'ended' listener on the share is taken off again at the end
     . a video that has played to its end is 'ended', never 'stalled', whatever
       length its player gave: YouTube's is the true length rounded UP to a whole
       second (596.501 s is 597) and its clock stops where the video does, up to a
       second short of it (measured, 2026-09-29: 7 of 13 videos stopped more than
       0.3 s short, and every one said "ended" as its clock stopped).  So a video
       that has played to within END_NEAR of its length is over when its player
       says "ended" -- or, of a player that cannot say, when its clock stands still
       for ten seconds.  A player that says it is paused or loading, or a clock
       that stops far from the end, is still a stall, and says so
     . cancel() -- and every other end -- stops playback and puts the player back
       as it was, closes both contexts, stops the clone, aborts what onChunk
       started, and leaves no timer and no state: a second record() works

   Plain ES2017, no build step, a classic script (no modules) so that the phone's
   copy of the player and its service worker need nothing special: served at
   /youtube/lib/tabcapture.js and kept for offline in lib/offline.py PLAYER_FILES. */
