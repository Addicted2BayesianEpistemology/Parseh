"""The deck store both card dashboards write into.

One deck directory layout, one card schema, one place that mints ids and
GUIDs -- shared by the video player's server (youtube/serve.py) and the
book reader's server (../serve.py), so a card is a card wherever it was
made and every deck holds both.  The decks themselves stay under
youtube/anki/, where they have always lived; see youtube/anki/README.md.

A deck is filed under its LANGUAGE, like every other kind of content in
the toolbox (docs/languages.md section 2):

    anki/<language folder>/<deck slug>/    deck.json, cards/, media/, deleted/
    anki/notetypes.json  seen.json  inbox/  build/   collection-level

Two decks of different languages may carry the same name, and therefore
the same slug -- they are in different folders, so nothing addresses a
deck by slug alone any more: (lang, slug), or the `path` decks() hands
back, which is what os.path.join with the anki directory wants.

Standard library only.  Each function takes the anki directory explicitly,
because the two servers compute it from different roots.
