"""Pull edits made INSIDE Anki back into the anki/ deck store.

    python3 lib/sync_apkg.py <deck exported from Anki>.apkg [--dry-run]

Why this exists.  The store is the ground truth the .apkg is built from,
and the build stamps every note "modified now" -- so importing a rebuilt
deck OVERWRITES, for every guid-matched note, whatever was edited inside
Anki since the last import.  The safe workflow is therefore pull before
push: export the deck from Anki (File > Export, "Anki Deck Package" --
scheduling does not matter, media included if images were edited), run
this script, and only then rebuild and re-import.  After a sync the store
says exactly what Anki says, so the re-import adds the new cards and
re-asserts identical content on the rest: no edit is lost, nothing
clashes.

What one sync does.  Notes are matched to store cards BY GUID, across
the WHOLE store -- a note moved to a different deck inside Anki is
updated where it lives here, and the move is reported:

  * guid known, note still one of this project's own note types (a
    language's vocab or opposites pair, anki_export.MODELS) and
    its fields still say only what the store can hold: the store card's
    content is UPDATED in place from the note -- fields, tags, the
    Reverse flag (emptying a note's Reverse inside Anki kills its
    reverse card, and that sticks), images and recordings (including one
    whose bytes changed under its old name).  The card keeps its file, its id
    and its provenance.
  * guid known, note converted to some OTHER note type inside Anki
    (Change Note Type -> Basic, say): the note has been TAKEN OVER by
    Anki.  The store card is rewritten as an "anki-owned" mirror -- guid
    and provenance kept, the note's model name and raw fields recorded --
    and anki_export.build_deck EXCLUDES owned cards from every future
    .apkg.  Since an Anki import never deletes notes, the note now lives
    in Anki alone, permanently out of this pipeline's reach.  This is the
    supported road to per-direction cards: inside Anki, duplicate the
    note and strip each copy to one direction (Change Note Type with the
    field mapping doing the work), then sync; both copies become owned
    mirrors here and no future export will touch or resurrect them.
  * guid known, note still a project note type but carrying formatting
    the store cannot represent (bold, colours, an extra field of HTML --
    anything a rebuild could not reproduce): treated exactly like a
    takeover, and reported as such.  Leaving it a normal card would mean
    the next export flattens the formatting; going anki-owned means Anki
    keeps it as made.  Strip the formatting inside Anki and the next
    sync reclaims the card automatically.
  * guid new, note of a project note type: a card created inside Anki --
    ADDED to the store as a normal card (file apkg-<guid>.json).
  * guid new, foreign note type (e.g. the duplicate made when splitting
    directions, which gets a fresh guid): added as an anki-owned mirror.
  * card in a synced deck whose guid the export does not carry anywhere:
    REPORTED, never deleted -- it is either a card added from the
    websites since the last import (fine, the next import adds it) or
    one deliberately deleted inside Anki (then delete the listed file by
    hand, or the next import resurrects it).  A script cannot tell the
    two apart, so it refuses to guess.

Reads every .apkg shape (modern zstd anki21b, Anki 2.1's plain anki21,
legacy anki2), like import_apkg.py, whose helpers it shares.  import_apkg.py remains the
bootstrap tool for a deck the store has never seen; THIS is the tool for
a deck it already holds (import_apkg would duplicate any card whose file
is not named after its guid).  A package this toolbox BUILT is never
synced -- it says nothing about what Anki holds -- and run_sync answers
with what import_apkg can bring in from it instead.
