"""Moving a caption's start on a video that is already on the shelf.

WHY THERE IS A DOOR HERE AT ALL.  subedit.js says, and says plainly, that
there is no editor for a video already in the player: "its transcript is what
its annotations were checked against, and a door that could rewrite it would
quietly unmake that check."  That is true of an editor that rewrites what a
caption SAYS, or splits one, or joins two, or takes one away -- every one of
those changes what the check compares, and the check would afterwards be
passing over a thing it had never seen.

A START is not one of those.  What check_annotations holds the two files to
is: the same number of captions as segments, each segment's start within half
a second of its caption's, and the text, the `plain` mark and the chapter the
same.  Move a start in BOTH files by the same amount and every one of those
is exactly as true afterwards as before -- the count did not change, the
difference between the two starts is still nothing, and no word was touched.
The check is kept, not unmade, and this file keeps it the way annwrite does:
it runs the checker before and after and refuses any error the edit itself
brought in (`_introduced`).

THE THREE FILES, AND THE NOTES.  A start is written in three places and read
from a fourth:
  * annotations.json -- what the player draws
  * transcript.txt   -- what the annotations were checked against
  * parts/NN.json    -- the batches, matched against the transcript by
                        EXACT equality when merge_parts rebuilds the
                        annotations, so a start left behind here turns the
                        next rebuild into an error
  * notes/           -- a note anchored `after cap 126` names a caption by
                        its start; left behind, the note comes adrift
Moving one and not the others is the whole of the danger, so they move
together here or not at all.
