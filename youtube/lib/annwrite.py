"""Edit one chunk of a video's annotations.json, and leave the file a
person can still edit by hand.

    from annwrite import edit_chunk
    edit_chunk("videos/persian/Gbfc-2sy_pc", 2, 1, {"en": "Midas is a king.",
                                                    "col": "red"})

annotations.json is AUTHORED, not generated.  Somebody opens it in an
editor, runs a find-and-replace over a gloss they have been spelling two
ways, saves, and reloads the player.  So an edit made from the player has
to land as the edit a hand would have made -- one line moved in the diff,
the same indentation, the same key order, the same unescaped Persian --
or the two ways of working stop being the same file and the player wins
by default.  Everything here exists to keep that true.

Three rules, and the reasons they are rules:

  * MATCH THE FILE, not this module's taste.  The indent, whether
    non-ASCII is escaped and whether the file ends in a newline are read
    off the file on disk (_style) and written back unchanged.  Only a
    video with no annotations.json yet gets a shape of our choosing, and
    that shape is merge_parts.py's, so a file written here and a file
    written by the pipeline are the same file.

  * VALIDATE FIRST.  The edit goes through check_annotations before
    anything is written, and is refused -- in the checker's own words --
    if it INTRODUCES an error the file does not already have.
    Introduces, not has: a video is glossed a box at a time, so in the
    middle of the work it is half glossed by definition, and an editor
    that refuses to work until the video is finished cannot be how the
    video gets finished.  So a chunk left half glossed is not this door's error
    (_errors); what it refuses instead is the one step backwards a hand
    can take, emptying a box a finished gloss needs (_emptied).

  * WRITE ATOMICALLY.  A temp file beside it, then a rename, so that a
    crash or a full disk cannot leave a video holding half a JSON file --
    which every reader of it, the player included, sees as no video at
    all.

Everything a caller gets wrong raises ValueError carrying a message meant
to be shown to the person who typed it; the server hands those back as a
400.  A video that has never been annotated raises OSError from the open,
because that is a missing file and not a bad request.

COLOURS is re-exported (`from annwrite import COLOURS`) so that whatever
draws the four buttons takes the four names from the checker rather than
writing them out again -- the same rule the registry keeps for languages.

Standard library only: this is imported by the server.

    A word line edited on a chunk nobody has glossed yet takes its proposed
