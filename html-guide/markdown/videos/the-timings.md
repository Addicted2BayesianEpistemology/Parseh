description: The one door that moves where a caption starts after a video is added — the sheet, its keys, estimating the rest — or only the next few seconds — by the text or by the sound, the picture of the sound, and why it moves nothing else.
---

**the timings**, in the player's bar beside **video info**, moves where each
caption **starts** — and nothing else — on a video that is already on the
shelf. The transcript editor of the add page does this *before* a video is
added; this is the one door that does it afterwards.

## Why only the start

A caption's text must equal its line of `transcript.txt`, and the checker
holds the video's two files to each other: the same number of captions,
each caption's start within half a second of its line's, the same words,
the same chapters. An editor that could rewrite what a caption **says**
would leave that check passing over something it had never seen.

A start is not one of those things. Move it in both files by the same
amount, and every rule is exactly as true afterwards as before: the count
did not change, the two starts still agree, no word was touched. So this
door moves starts, and moves them everywhere a start is written, all
together or not at all:

- `annotations.json`, what the player draws;
- `transcript.txt`, what the annotations are checked against;
- the [notes](notes-in-the-seam.md) anchored to the caption, under
  `markdown/`;
- the batches under `parts/`, on a video added before `parts/` was
  [retired](the-files.md#parts).

It runs the checker before and after, and refuses whatever its own move
would break, in the checker's words.

> **The notes move with it.** A [note](notes-in-the-seam.md) names its
> caption by that caption's start, so a start that moved without it left
> the note pointing at nothing — it kept the old number and was shown
> adrift at the end of the transcript. The move carries them now: the
> `anchor:` line of every note anchored to a caption that moved is written
> with its new start, in the same breath as the two files.

## The sheet

![The timings sheet: the caption being timed with its neighbours, the six steps, the row of estimate the next 10 seconds with its box and its by the text / by the sound switch, and the picture of the sound](shots/timings.png)

The button opens a sheet, **the timings —** and the video's id, over the
player. From the top:

- **before**, **here**, **after** — the caption being timed and its two
  neighbours, with their times, so you can see what you are placing;
- a line saying which caption it is, and from when to when it runs;
- **starts** — the caption's start: **−1** **−.5** **−.1**, the time
  itself (type one and press Enter), **+.1** **+.5** **+1**, and **◉**,
  which puts it where the sound stands now;
- **ends** — the same row for where it ends. A caption runs until the next
  one begins, so its end **is** the next caption's start, and moving it
  moves the next caption;
- **▶ hear it** — the caption, from its start to where the next begins;
  **▶ across the join** — the second before its boundary and the second
  after, to hear whether the line falls in the right place;
  **into the quiet**, and **estimate the rest** with its switch, **by the
  text** or **by the sound**, and a box for the next few seconds (below);
- the **strip**: the picture of the sound, a tinted band for each caption,
  a line at every boundary, and the playhead. Drag a line; click a band to
  take that caption up. **−** and **+** zoom out and in, **fit** returns to
  the caption and its neighbours, **all** shows the whole video; the wheel
  scrolls along it, and the wheel with Shift or Ctrl zooms.

Nothing is written until **save the timings** — which counts what you
moved, *save the timings (3)* — and **cancel**, **✕** or Esc leave without
saving. When it is saved the sheet closes, the player says *3 captions
moved*, and the transcript is redrawn at the new times without a reload.

### The keys

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| ← → (↓ ↑) | move the line being timed by 0.1 s; with Shift, 0.5 s |
| Space | play the caption, or stop |
| **,** and **.** (also `<` `>`, `[` `]`, PageUp and PageDown) | take up the caption before, or after |
| **F** | bring the view back onto the caption being timed |
| **S** | **into the quiet**: move the line to the middle of the nearest stretch where the sound falls away |
| **E** | **estimate the rest**: a fresh guess over every caption after this line — by the text or by the sound, whichever is pressed; with seconds in the box beside the button, only the next stretch of that length |
| Enter | save (in a time box: take the time typed) |
| Esc | leave without saving |

The comma and the full stop lead because they are unshifted on every
keyboard, where the brackets hide behind AltGr on an Italian or a French
one. The letter keys, the comma and the full stop, the brackets and the
page keys do nothing with Ctrl, Alt or ⌘ held, so Ctrl+F and the rest stay
the browser's; the arrows, Space, Enter and Esc answer whatever else is
held.

**into the quiet** does what the eye has already done: a boundary belongs
in the silence between two words, and the eye finds that gap on the strip
long before the hand can drag onto the middle of it. It looks either side
of the line for the nearest stretch where the sound drops away — how far it
looks depends on how far you are zoomed in — and puts the line in the
middle of it. With no picture of the sound it is greyed out: *there is no
picture of the sound here to find the quiet in*.

### Estimate the rest: by the text or by the sound

**estimate the rest** is for the middle of a long job: a hand works left to
right, and by the time the tenth boundary is right the fortieth is still
where a first guess put it. It lays the guess again over everything **after**
the line in hand, and touches nothing before it. Beside it sit two buttons
that work as a switch, **by the text** and **by the sound**: the one pressed
is how the button, and **E**, make the guess.

**by the text** is the guess it has always made: each caption given a slice
of what is left in proportion to how much text it has. It needs no picture
of the sound, and it hears nothing.

**by the sound** lays the captions through the picture of the sound. A
caption's start goes into the pause before its first word, just before the
voice comes back, where the length of the text allows one there; between the
pauses the text is shared out at the pace of the speech, followed as it
changes. It hears **where the voice stops and starts**, and never **which
word is which**: nothing recognises speech. So it is a better first guess,
not an alignment — play the boundaries and correct what is off. A caption
cut in the middle of a sentence has no pause to sit in, and its start is the
likeliest to need your ear.

When it is done it says how many boundaries it could put in a pause: *30
pieces after this estimated from the sound — 24 of the 29 boundaries sit in a
pause it heard; nothing to the left of it moved*. The caption at the line
keeps its start, and nothing is written until **save the timings**:
**cancel** leaves without the guess — and without everything else moved
since the sheet was opened.

**Captions with no punctuation** — auto-captions as YouTube leaves them, which
it does for Persian and Arabic — are its weakest case: with no sentence ends
to hold on to, a long stretch can drift by a second or two, and in a short
Chinese stretch by the text can do better. Captions put into sentences by
[**✨ tidy up**](mending-the-transcript.md#-tidy-up) when the video was added
carry their full stops, and fare as well as any.

It reads the rest of the video, from the line to its end, so the time depends
on how much is left: a few seconds for an hour, up to about a minute for four
hours, more on a computer busy with something else. Meanwhile the sheet says
*estimating from the sound…* — or, over a stretch that stops short of the end,
*estimating the next 28.6 s from the sound…* — and holds its lines still, and
the work is on
the [**Working…**](../getting-started/working-indicator.md) list —
*Estimating a video's timings by the sound* — where the hub and any other
page see it. While it waits, **estimate the rest** reads **stop
estimating**: it, or **Esc**, gives the wait up, and everything you moved
by hand stays — as on a book's sheet, where the rest is said too: one
estimate at a time, and a deadline of a few minutes
([Fixing the timings](../books/timings.md#estimate-the-rest-by-the-text-or-by-the-sound)).

It needs a picture of the sound, and without one it is greyed, its tooltip
saying why:

- **A film on this machine.** The server reads the film itself with ffmpeg,
  as it does for the strip. Only on a computer without ffmpeg is there none:
  *there is no picture of the sound here to estimate by — it is drawn by
  ffmpeg, on the computer Parseh runs on*.
- **A YouTube video.** Its only picture is the one **● draw the sound**
  records ([below](#the-picture-of-the-sound)) — twenty numbers a second,
  against a film's hundred, and nearly as good for this. Until it has been
  drawn: *draw the sound first (“● draw the sound”, above the picture): there
  is no picture of it here yet to estimate by*. In a browser that cannot draw
  it, it says so, and why: *there is no picture of the sound here to estimate
  by, and it cannot be drawn in this browser: …*. Captions after the end of
  what was drawn are refused when **E** is pressed: *the picture of this
  video’s sound ends before this stretch begins, so it cannot be estimated by
  the sound: estimate it by the text*.

While it is greyed, **by the text** shows pressed and **E** goes by the text.
Your choice is kept all the same: draw the sound, and **by the sound** is
back in force at once. The choice is remembered in this browser, for videos
and books alike ([Fixing the timings](../books/timings.md#estimate-the-rest-by-the-text-or-by-the-sound)).

### Only the next few seconds

The guess over everything after the line is often more than the next stretch
of work needs. Beside **estimate the rest**, between it and the switch, a
small box reads **the next [ ] s**. Type a number of seconds in it — **90**,
or **1:30** — and the button reads **estimate the next 90 seconds**
(**estimate the next 1 second**, for one): the same act, **by the text** or
**by the sound** as the switch says, over a shorter stretch. **E** runs
whatever the button reads.

- **Which captions.** From the line in hand, the stretch runs to the
  **caption start closest to that many seconds after it** — a start that is
  already there — or to the end of the video, when that is the closest.
  Closest means on either side, so 90 seconds may end a little before the
  ninetieth second or a little after it, and a tie goes to the shorter
  stretch. It always holds at least one caption, so a number shorter than the
  first still estimates that one; and when the closest start is the end of the
  video — the number reaches it, or is nearer to it than to the last caption's
  start — it is exactly **estimate the rest**, which the status says. The button's tooltip says how
  many captions the number makes of it today, how many seconds and up to
  when — worth reading when the captions are long, because the rounding can
  land well away from the number you typed.
- **What does not move.** Nothing before the line, as ever — and nothing from
  the start the stretch ends at on: that caption keeps its start, and so does
  every one after it. The last caption of the stretch runs until that start,
  as the last caption of the rest runs until the end of the video.
- **What it says.** The status names the stretch as it was laid, with the
  real number of seconds after the rounding: *5 pieces in the next 28.6 s (to
  3:41.20) estimated from the sound — 3 of the 4 boundaries sit in a pause it
  heard; nothing outside that stretch moved*.
- **A shorter wait.** Only the sound of the stretch is read — or, for a
  YouTube video, only the stretch of the picture you recorded is sent — so
  **by the sound** takes time in proportion to the stretch, and not to
  everything that is left.
- **Empty is the rest.** The box starts empty on every sheet and is not
  remembered: how far to estimate is decided each time, for the stretch in
  front of you; the switch is the habit that is remembered. Seconds are typed
  as **90**, **1.5** or **1:30**. Anything else — letters, a minus sign —
  turns the box red, and pressing the button or **E** is refused in words:
  *the box must hold seconds (90 or 1:30) or be empty; nothing was
  estimated*. So is **0**, or a number so small that it rounds to nothing,
  with *the seconds in the box must be above zero, or the box empty; nothing
  was estimated*. It never guesses what was meant.
- **While you type.** The keys are the box's while it has the focus: a full
  stop or a comma typed in it does not step to the next caption. **Enter**
  takes the number and gives the sheet its keys back; it does not estimate —
  press **E** or the button for that.

## The picture of the sound

**A film on this machine** has one for nothing: the server reads the film
itself with ffmpeg, window by window, at whatever detail the view needs —
exactly as it does a book's narration.

**A YouTube video** has no file any script here can read, so it has no
picture of its sound unless you ask for one. **● draw the sound**, beside
the zoom buttons, plays the video once, from beginning to end, while
recording this tab, and keeps the **shape** of what it heard — twenty
numbers a second — in `waveform.json` beside the video. It is done once:
every later visit draws it, and it travels in the video's download.

- It takes as long as the video does, and the button says so before you
  press it.
- It needs **Chrome or Edge** on a computer, reached at Parseh's own https
  address; anywhere else the button is greyed, and its tooltip says why.
  The first time, the browser asks to share the tab: press **Allow** and
  leave **Also allow tab audio** on.
- While it listens it says *listening… 42%*, and the video plays at normal
  speed. The sound itself is never kept, and never needs to be: the player
  can play any second of the video on its own.
- What can go wrong, it says: *the share came without its sound — share
  this tab again and leave “Also allow tab audio” turned on*; *nothing was
  heard — the tab was shared without its sound, or the video is muted*;
  *the tab stopped being shared while the sound was being drawn*.

Without a picture the sheet still works: the steps, the typed times, ◉ and
▶ move a caption perfectly well by ear. Only **into the quiet** and **by the
sound** need one. The button's tooltip in the bar
says when there is no waveform, and why.

## What it refuses

| It says | Which means |
|---|---|
| *that would put caption 3 at 11.5, before caption 2 at 12: a caption cannot start before the one in front of it* | starts never go backwards (two captions may start at the same moment) |
| *caption 3 starts at 12.5, not at 12: the video has been written by another hand since this was opened -- reload it and move it again* | the page is out of date |
| *transcript.txt carries 7 captions and annotations.json 6: mend that before moving any of them* | the two files already disagree; the checker says how |
| *that would break the video: …* | the move brings in an error the checker would refuse, in its words |
| *this video has no captions to time* | there is nothing to move (the button is greyed out) |
| *the player has not loaded yet* | the video itself has not loaded — a YouTube video with no internet, a film whose file is gone or that this browser cannot play. The button looks ready, but the timings need the video: they play it, and read where it stands |

`transcript.txt` is written back in the plainest form of a pasted panel:
a fraction only where a start has one (`0:12.5`), a chapter marker as
`Chapter 1: …`, and no spoken-duration lines.
