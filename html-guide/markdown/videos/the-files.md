description: What a video is on disk — video.json, transcript.txt, annotations.json, parts, notes, the waveform and the film — field by field, and the tools behind the pages.
---

Every page of the Videos door reads and writes a handful of plain files in
one folder, and reads them afresh on every visit: drop a video's folder in
place and it is on the shelf, with nothing to build and nothing to restart.
You never need to open them — every change has a page — but knowing what is
in them explains what the pages check, and lets a text editor do what a page
cannot, such as one find-and-replace across a whole video's meanings.

## One folder per video

```text
youtube/videos/
  persian/                        the language's folder: persian, arabic, italian,
    <id>/                         japanese, french, german, turkish, english,
      video.json                  hindi, spanish, chinese
      transcript.txt              the pasted transcript: the source of truth
      annotations.json            what the player draws
      parts/01.json …             the batches an LLM's answer was saved as
      markdown/persian/<note>/    the notes, one studio document each
      waveform.json               the drawn picture of a YouTube video's sound
      media.mp4                   the film, for a film on this machine
  .trash/                         videos taken off the shelf, or replaced
```

`<id>` is the YouTube id, eleven characters, or for a film the id made from
its name. The player's address carries only the id, `/youtube/v/<id>/`,
because an id is unique across languages. Only the first three files are
needed; the others appear when there is something to put in them.

## video.json

| Field | Is |
|---|---|
| `id` | the video's id |
| `url` | its YouTube address; empty for a film on this machine |
| `title` | the title in Latin letters |
| `title_native` | a short title in the video's own language, for its card (older files spell it `title_fa`, which is still read) |
| `channel` | the channel it is filed under — the only place a channel exists |
| `language` | the language it **teaches**, a registry code: `fa`, `ar`, `it`, `ja`, `fr`, `de`, `tr`, `en`, `hi`, `es`, `zh` |
| `gloss` | the language its meanings are **written** in; English when absent |
| `level` | `beginner`, `lower-intermediate`, `intermediate`, `upper-intermediate` or `advanced` |
| `duration` | about how long it is, the last caption's time |
| `added` | the day it was added |
| `blurb` | one sentence for the card |
| `reorders` | `true` for a text read out of its written order ([kanbun](video-info-and-drafts.md#kanbun)) |

`language` and `gloss` are never to be read for each other: an Italian
learning English watches a video with `"language": "en", "gloss": "it"`. The
gloss may also be a language the toolbox does not teach — `pt`, `nl`, `ca`,
`ro`, `pl`, `ru`, `en-gb`, `en-us`. The folder should agree with the
language; if it does not, the JSON wins for drawing the page and the server
says so once in its log.

## transcript.txt

The pasted transcript, the **single source of truth**: every caption's
start, its text, its chapter heading and whether it is plain are read from
it, and the phrases are checked against it letter for letter.

```text
0:00
Hello everyone, welcome to today's lesson
0:05
こんにちは、みなさん
Chapter 1: 朝
0:09.4
今日は 天気が いいですね
```

- A **time** line starts a caption: `0:05`, `1:02:03`, and a fraction where
  there is one, `0:09.4`.
- The lines under it are what is said, joined into one caption.
- A **chapter marker** — a word for *chapter* in any of the toolbox's
  languages, a number, a separator and a title: `Chapter 1: …`,
  `Capitolo 3: …`, `第3章：…`, `فصل ۱: …` — becomes a heading over the
  **next** caption. A bare number is speech.
- A **spoken-duration** line under a time (`1 minuto e 6 secondi`,
  `۱ دقیقه و ۳ ثانیه`) is dropped.
- A caption is **plain** — shown as it stands, never glossed — when the
  language has a script of its own and the caption has not one character of
  it. For a language in Latin letters nothing is plain by itself: an aside
  is a phrase marked `"plain": true` instead.

Never retype it. After a video is added, the only change any page makes to
it is a caption's start, through [the timings](the-timings.md).

## annotations.json

What the player draws: the id, the language, and one **segment** per
caption, in the transcript's order.

```json
{"video": "aB3dE5fG7hI", "language": "ja", "segments": [
 {"start": 0, "plain": true,
  "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to today's lesson"},
 {"start": 5, "text": "こんにちは、みなさん",
  "chunks": [
   {"fa": "こんにちは、", "kana": "こんにちは、", "tr": "konnichiwa,", "en": "hello,"},
   {"fa": "みなさん", "kana": "みなさん", "tr": "minasan", "en": "everyone"}
  ]},
 {"start": 9.4, "chapter": "朝",
  "text": "今日は 天気が いいですね",
  "chunks": [
   {"fa": "今日は", "words": "今日(きょう) は", "kana": "きょうは", "tr": "kyō wa",
    "voc": "今日 きょう kyō today; は wa topic marker", "en": "today", "col": "blue"},
   {"fa": "天気が", "kana": "てんきが", "tr": "tenki ga", "en": "the weather"},
   {"fa": "いいですね", "kana": "いいですね", "tr": "ii desu ne", "en": "is nice, isn't it"}
  ]}
]}
```

A segment carries its `start`, its `text` (the caption's), its `chapter`
where the transcript has one, `"plain": true` for a caption in another
language — which then has no phrases — and its `chunks`, the phrases:

| Field | Holds |
|---|---|
| `fa` | the phrase's text — named after Persian, the toolbox's first language, whatever the language is |
| `words` | Japanese, Chinese: the phrase's words, each with its reading in ASCII parentheses; joined with nothing they must be `fa` exactly |
| `kana` | Japanese: the reading of the whole phrase |
| `tr` | the transliteration — required where the language wants one, optional for a language in Latin letters |
| `voc` | the vocabulary line, plain text: a word's first appearance in the video, and rarely after |
| `en` | the meaning — named after English, and written in the video's `gloss` language |
| `note` | anything else worth saying: what the automatic transcript really heard, a cultural point |
| `plain` | `true` for a phrase asked for nothing: an aside in another language, in a language written in Latin letters |
| `col` | `red`, `blue`, `orange` or `green`: your own mark |
| `free` | `true`: this phrase need not reproduce `transcript.txt` ([When YouTube heard wrong](editing-a-phrase.md#when-youtube-heard-wrong)) |

Absent and empty mean the same thing everywhere, so the pages remove a field
you empty rather than leave `"col": ""` behind.

**The rules the checker holds it to:**

- one segment per caption of the transcript, the same start (within half a
  second), the same text, the same chapter, the same plain mark — except
  that a caption holding a `free` phrase is not held to the transcript's
  text, and is counted in a warning instead;
- the phrases of a segment, **joined back** with the language's separator —
  a space, or nothing for Japanese and Chinese, whose spaces are ignored —
  **reproduce** its text; the language's marks (the harakat of Persian and
  Arabic) are set aside first, and nothing else is;
- every phrase of the language that has any gloss written has all the
  fields its language requires: the meaning; the transliteration where
  required; the kana for Japanese. A phrase with **nothing** written in it
  is legal in every video, and is only counted, in one note (*12 of 40
  chunks have no gloss yet*); a phrase half glossed is an error;
- a colour is one of the four; `words`, where present, give back `fa`;
- a phrase longer than **seven words** is warned about: the conventions ask
  for two to six.

### parts/ is retired {#parts}

A video added from an LLM's answer is assembled from that answer in batches
of twenty-five captions, under `parts/`. They live only while the video is
being added: `merge_parts.py` folds them into `annotations.json`, the
checker passes on it, and the batches are dropped before the video reaches
the shelf. **A video on the shelf has no `parts/`, and `annotations.json`
is its only annotation** — the player writes it, and nothing rebuilds it.

That is new since the 23rd of September 2026, and it is there because the
old arrangement lost work: every change made in the player went to
`annotations.json` alone, so a `merge_parts.py` run again by hand rebuilt
the file from the old answer and threw those changes away — the colours,
the edited glosses, the phrases cut and joined — without a word.

A video added before that date still has its batches on disk. Nothing
reads them, and you may delete the folder. If you do run `merge_parts.py`
on such a video, it now refuses when `annotations.json` is newer than the
batches, and says how many captions and which fields the rebuild would
have lost.

## The other files

- **`markdown/`** holds the [notes](notes-in-the-seam.md), in the studio's
  own layout.
- **`waveform.json`** is `{"rate": 20, "peaks": [0, 0.12, …]}`: the shape
  of a YouTube video's sound, twenty numbers a second between 0 and 1,
  recorded once by [**● draw the sound**](the-timings.md#the-picture-of-the-sound).
  A film has none: the server reads the film.
- **`media.<ext>`** is the film of [a film on this machine](a-film-on-this-machine.md).
  It is kept out of git; the rest can be.

## For the command line {#for-the-command-line}

```bash
cd youtube
V=videos/persian/<id>
python3 lib/check_annotations.py $V        # the whole check; it must end: 0 error(s)
python3 lib/slice_part.py $V               # how the captions divide into batches
python3 lib/slice_part.py $V 0 25          # captions 0..24, verbatim, to annotate
python3 lib/check_part.py $V parts/01.json # one batch, checked on its own
python3 lib/merge_parts.py $V              # parts/ + transcript.txt -> annotations.json, once, while adding
python3 lib/import_old_video.py <dir>      # a video in the older watching-edition format
cd ..
python3 lib/draft.py video --transcript t.txt --lang fa --url <URL> --into youtube/videos
python3 lib/fill_words.py --video youtube/$V   # Japanese, Chinese: the words a video lacks
python3 lib/bundle.py pack <id>            # the ⤓ zip; `inspect` and `install` take one back
```

The fidelity check sets the language's marks aside before comparing, so it
cannot see a vowel written wrong, and it knows nothing about whether a
meaning is right. A clean check means the text matches — reread the
glosses yourself.
