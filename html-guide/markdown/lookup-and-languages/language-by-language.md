description: Levels, readings, words, vertical text, verb entries, transliteration schemes and the reading help — everything that is not the same in all eleven languages.

The doors, the buttons and the file formats are the same for every
language. This page is everything that is not: what each language needs to
be read, and what each part of Parseh does about it.

## The levels of a reading edition

A reading edition gives each passage several times — as **levels** — and how
many, and what each one is, depends on the language. The reader shows one
button per level in its header, named as below and captioned *levels*; each
button's tooltip says what the level shows, and turning one off hides that
level. The names are each language's own defaults, and a person can change
them ([Levels and their names](../books/levels.md)).

| Language | Its levels, by the name on their button |
|---|---|
| Persian | **With vowels** the vowelled attempt · **Chunks** chunks and glosses · **Plain** bare naskh · **Nastaliq** nastaliq |
| Arabic | **With vowels** the vowelled attempt · **Chunks** chunks and glosses · **Plain** unvowelled, as Arabic is written |
| Japanese | **Furigana** with furigana over each word · **Kana only** the reading alone, in kana · **Chunks** chunks and glosses · **Plain** plain, as Japanese is written · **Vertical** vertical (tategaki) |
| Chinese | **Pinyin** with pinyin over each word · **Pinyin only** the reading alone, in pinyin · **Chunks** chunks and glosses · **Plain** plain, as Chinese is written · **Vertical** vertical |
| Italian, French, German, Turkish, English, Spanish, Hindi | **Sentence** the sentence · **Chunks** chunks and glosses |

Why these and not others:

- **A plain level exists only where it shows something the first does not.**
  Persian and Arabic are written in the reading editions with their vowel
  marks (harakat) — the first level, **With vowels**, is *the vowelled attempt* — and **Plain**
  takes them off, as the languages are normally printed. Japanese and
  Chinese take away the readings over the words. The Latin-script languages
  and Hindi have nothing to take off (Devanagari writes its vowels), so
  their first level, **Sentence**, already shows all a plain level could.
- **A fourth face** is Persian's alone: the passage again in **nastaliq**,
  the calligraphic hand of Persian poetry and titles.
- **Japanese and Chinese have a reading level and a vertical level.** In
  the first level each word of a chunk wears its reading over it, where the chunk
  carries its word line (a Japanese chunk without one wears its kana over
  the whole of it); **Kana only** (**Pinyin only**) is the reading alone — the passage in kana, or
  in pinyin, as it is said, with the punctuation that ends each chunk —
  and **Vertical** sets the passage in columns read top to bottom and right to
  left.
- **Persian and Arabic can put the marks away.** **Diacritics**, in the ⚙ panel, takes
  the very marks the plain level leaves off from the first two levels, and from a
  video's lines — on the screen only ([Levels and their names](../books/levels.md#diacritics)).

## Readings, words and columns

| | Japanese | Chinese | the rest |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Transliteration line** | rōmaji (Hepburn) | pinyin, with tone marks | see below |
| **A reading beside it** | **kana**: every glossed chunk carries it, and the checkers require it | none — pinyin *is* the transliteration | none |
| **Words** | every chunk may carry a **word line**, `山(やま) へ 柴刈り(しばかり) に`: its words and each word's reading | the same, with pinyin: `我(wǒ) 想(xiǎng) 喝(hē) 茶(chá)` | no need: spaces already divide the words |
| **Vertical text** | the **Vertical** level; a studio block with `vertical` | the same | — |
| **No word separator** | a chunk counts as one word everywhere; the dictionary cuts it (or follows its word line) | the same | — |

The word line is what the furigana of the first level stand over, what the
[dictionary](dictionaries.md) looks up word by word, and what the cloud's
*山: I know this* buttons work by: a word you know stops wearing its reading
wherever it appears in that book or video. The video player of a Japanese
or Chinese video has one more button, named after the reading — **kana only** or
**pinyin only** — which shows every phrase as it is said, in place of its text.

## The transliteration, language by language

Each language's rules for writing its lines live in its **conventions
file**, `docs/lang/<code>.md` — the rules every prompt that asks a model to
annotate that language includes, and the page to read when you wonder why
a gloss is written the way it is.

| Language | The transliteration line |
|---|---|
| **Persian** | required. A scheme of its own: long *ā*, *š č ž x q*, the emphatics flattened, transparent morphology hyphenated (*mi-kone*, *ketāb-hā*); what is *said*, colloquial forms included. |
| **Arabic** | required. A scholarly scheme: *ā ī ū*, *ʾ* and *ʿ*, the emphatics with a dot under them. |
| **Hindi** | required, because the script hides what it does not say: the inherent *a* printed in every consonant and often silent — कमल is *kamal*. Every noun is glossed with *m.* or *f.* |
| **Japanese** | required: Hepburn rōmaji written from the kana (*Tōkyō*, particles *wa e o* as said). |
| **Chinese** | required: pinyin with tone marks, never numbers; the neutral tone unmarked. |
| **Italian**, **Spanish** | optional, and given only where the spelling misleads — Italian's open and closed *e* and *o* and its stress, Spanish's silent *h*. Most chunks need none. |
| **German** | optional, where the spelling misleads (vowel length, the two *ch*, stress). Capitals are spelling — a noun always has one — and a separable verb is glossed as the whole verb, however far apart its halves are. |
| **Turkish** | optional and rarely needed: the spelling is phonemic. The vocabulary line carries the morphology instead — a word's stem and each suffix in order. |
| **French** | optional in principle, given on almost every chunk in practice: the spelling hides the sound (silent endings, nasal vowels, liaisons). A respelling, not IPA. |
| **English** | written for every chunk with a word in it, in IPA, General American: English spelling is the least reliable guide to sound of any here. |

## Verb entries

A vocabulary line gives a verb as a **`\vb`**: three forms, each with its
sound, then the meaning — the same shape in every language. What the three
forms *are*, and the two labels printed before the second and third, are
each language's:

| Language | The three forms | Printed labels |
|---|---|---|
| Persian | infinitive · present stem · past stem | *pres.* / *past* |
| Arabic | perfect (3rd m. sg.; its form number in the sound) · imperfect (3rd m. sg.) · masdar | *impf.* / *masdar* |
| Italian | infinitive · 1st sg. present · past participle | *pres.* / *p.p.* |
| Japanese | dictionary form · -masu stem · -te form | *stem* / *-te* |
| French | infinitive · 1st sg. present · past participle | *pres.* / *p.p.* |
| German | infinitive · preterite (3rd sg.) · past participle | *pret.* / *p.p.* |
| Turkish | infinitive · present in -iyor (3rd sg.) · aorist (3rd sg.) | *pres.* / *aor.* |
| English | plain form · past · past participle | *past* / *p.p.* |
| Hindi | infinitive · stem · perfective (m. sg.) | *stem* / *perf.* |
| Spanish | infinitive · 1st sg. present · 3rd sg. preterite | *pres.* / *pret.* |
| Chinese | verb · A了B (a separable verb only) · A不B (a verb with a complement only) | *split* / *can't* |

A pair left blank is not printed at all — a Chinese verb has its *split*
form or its *can't* form, never both. Whatever else a language's verbs need
goes in one parenthesis after the meaning: *to drive (er fährt; aux.
sein)*. The chunk sheet's `\vb{}{}{}{}{}{}{}` button names the three
forms of the book's language in its tooltip, and the dictionary's verb entries, where a
language's recipe recognises a verb, arrive in exactly this shape
([Dictionaries](dictionaries.md)). Every one of the eleven languages has
such a recipe.

The chapters on each door have the details: this page only says what the
language decides.
