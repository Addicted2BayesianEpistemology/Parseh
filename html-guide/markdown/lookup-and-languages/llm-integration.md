title: LLM Integration
weight: 9
description: An OpenAI-compatible connection, remote model selection, installed correction skills and explicit browser transcript review.
---

**Settings → LLM Integration** connects browser features to an endpoint you
already run. It starts unconfigured. Whisper and manual transcript entry work
without it. Parseh installs no model software, downloads no weights and starts
no endpoint.

All four transcript-correction methods are **experimental**: suspect-word
correction, whole-text review, reasoning workspace review and LM likelihood.
They can miss errors and suggest wrong changes. Check each proposed change
before using the transcript.

The additional [LM likelihood](lm-likelihood.md) method has its own installed
GGUF selection and isolated scoring runtime. It uses numerical token scores
instead of a chat request; configure it in its separate Settings door.

## Configure the connection

Choose **Ollama**, **Unsloth** or **Generic OpenAI-compatible**. Presets supply
defaults and share the text adapter. Ollama prefills
`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`. For Unsloth use your installation's API address
ending in `/v1`; ports vary. The Parseh host reaches the address, so `localhost`
means that host. Hosted or other-computer HTTP(S) endpoints are also possible.

The **API key** control keeps, replaces or clears the masked key explicitly.
It stays in the host's private `config/llm.json`, outside releases and synced
preferences, and is never returned after saving. Endpoint, credential, adapter
and timeout/context changes are made on the host.

**Model selection is available from any device admitted to Parseh**, in the
Browser interface. **Refresh models** lists advertised models. Choose one or
enter an exact ID, then **Save model selection**. This changes only the model,
retaining the destination and credentials. Listing is advisory: the model may
be unloaded later. A small multilingual Qwen model is a starting point; choose
one that works well for your language and computer.

Set the timeout and context budget to match your endpoint. Parseh reserves
instructions/output space and uses bounded sentences with conservative UTF-8
byte estimates. **Save connection** saves all host controls. **Test saved
connection** asks the saved model for a short synthetic text reply and checks
reachability/authentication. It does not establish correction accuracy.
**Clear connection** leaves all Whisper runtimes and models intact.

## Unsloth share links

**Saved Unsloth model profiles** retains up to eight Studio share links.
Paste a link and profile name, then **Save profile link**. **Load selected
profile** uses Studio's API to load an already installed GGUF variant with
its KV-cache type, optional context length and vision option. Missing files
and unsupported link options are refused without downloading anything.
Vision defaults off when omitted; speculative decoding is off. Sentence reviews
disable thinking. The additional workspace review requests reasoning.
Studio controls hardware placement; Parseh reads the loaded context budget.

Profiles and model selection are available from any admitted browser. Profile
links must use the saved endpoint; changing that destination or its key remains
host-only. A failed or unconfirmed load blocks inference until you retry the
profile or deliberately select a loaded model.

Under **Models for transcript review**, choose separate profiles or exact model
IDs for **suspect-word correction**, **whole-text review** and **reasoning
workspace review**. An empty ID uses
the general selection. Starting a review explicitly loads its assigned installed
Studio profile first. It never loads a model on opening a page. Compatible
servers without Studio's native API use saved model IDs directly.

**Import Unsloth run settings** is a separate host-only convenience for reading
an endpoint/model hint. It does not execute the link. Use saved profiles to apply
options through the API, or open the link in Studio.

Create an Unsloth API key using the avatar's **Settings → API** page. Name it,
press **Create** and copy it while shown; Studio shows the key once.

## Review a Whisper result

When [speech to text](speech-to-text.md) finishes on
[Add a video](../videos/adding-a-video.md#speech-to-text), the transcript box
stays unchanged and the transcript workspace opens for editing immediately.
No tool selection is required. **Suspect words**, **Whole-text review**,
**Reasoning workspace**, **LM likelihood** and **Whisper second pass** are
tools you can try on the same draft. Manual edits and locked words survive
later tool runs. The saved LLM destination/model are shown before sending;
connected LLM requests start only when you press a tool button.

**⚠** marks an available Whisper score below **0.5**, not proof a word is wrong.
Missing scores stay missing. **◇** marks a word with no meaning in the installed
language dictionary, using the readers' normalization, base-form and prefix
rules. A dictionary miss is also a suspect-word target, even with a high ASR
score; names and rare words can be valid. An absent or failing dictionary does
not flag words. The word inspector shows dictionary meanings for Whisper's
original, each native Whisper alternative and each proposed LLM alternative,
so you can compare them before
accepting an edit. Meanings use the installed dictionary's language, normally
English, independently of the video's gloss language.

**✎** marks a proposed LLM substitution. Focus, hover or tap any word to inspect
evidence or edit it. Only suspect words' available alternatives are sent as
readable hints. The same faster-whisper backend now retains up to five native
beam hypotheses and exposes substitutions that map unambiguously to a source
word. Their **sequence log scores** rank complete recognition hypotheses;
alternative-word probabilities stay unavailable. An empty list means no
unambiguous word alternative was returned, not that the word is correct.
There is no extra recognizer or model download. The model may choose a
better word beyond those hints. Its answer is a complete sentence; Parseh maps
only unambiguous substitutions for suspect words back to their exact spans.
Whole-text review checks every mapped word, including confident words, and can
propose a short contiguous span covering several ASR pieces. The two reviews
have separate prompts and skills. Nearby captions provide bounded read-only
context and are never included in the replaceable target.

Accept or reject individual proposals. Even when no proposal or ASR alternative
exists, **Enter the correct word** and **Save word in draft** lets you type the
correction yourself. Any reviewable word can be edited, including words without
scores. **Restore Whisper word** undoes its edit. **Pending transcript draft**
shows the pending result. Only **Use this transcript** writes it into the box,
after the existing overwrite confirmation if needed. Cancel leaves the box
untouched. Source, language, Whisper-model or box changes discard stale review.
Caption boundaries and video clocks stay unchanged; edited word timings need
review in the existing timing editor. Using the transcript deletes any
privately held capture audio.

## Choose a section, keep checked words, or pause

Use **Select a section**, then click its first and last word. Select **Selected
section** to limit any review method to that range. Surrounding text remains
available for context. **All text** restores the full scope.

**Select best for all** chooses the latest method's first alternatives in the
pending draft. Locked words are skipped; incomplete likelihood comparisons and
ties also remain unchanged. Check the choices before using them. **I'm sure ·
lock word** preserves a checked word through later reviews. Unlock to edit it.

**Save & pause** stops model work and keeps the original, pending corrections,
locks, section and pasted answer drafts on disk. **Continue pending
transcription** on Videos or Add Video restores them without automatically
calling a model. This works across browser and server restarts. **Use this
transcript** or discarding the review removes its temporary disk draft. Audio
is not retained; a local source video must still exist at its original path.

## Reasoning workspace review

This is an additional tool; sentence reviews and direct manual editing
remain available. Choose a model supporting reasoning and external tool calls
under **Models for transcript review → Reasoning workspace profile**. For
Unsloth, save its Studio share link and select that profile. It loads only when
you explicitly start its review. Use the endpoint's actual context length;
workspace review requires at least 8192 tokens.

Parseh creates a private temporary workspace containing the entire transcript
without timestamps. Suspects are replaced by numbered blanks. The Whisper
threshold remains **0.5**; installed-dictionary misses are a separate cue.
A CSV pairs each number with the original guess, unchanged Whisper confidence
(or “unavailable”), nearby context and genuine optional ASR alternatives.
Additional CSV files supply stable source IDs and exact caption spacing.

The model first skims unblanked text for missed errors, then processes numbered
entries. Both passes use bounded regions, with access to the full transcript
through real files. Tentative first-pass proposals provide context to the second
pass. The bundled skill supplies a small CSV helper so the model can inspect evidence
and save proposals with short Python calls. It still has real file/code tools.
The model runs Python to read files and produce a small proposals CSV;
Parseh checks IDs, exact original spans, duplicates and local substitutions.
These are proposals, not a replacement transcript. All still need your approval.

Python runs on the Parseh host under **Linux bubblewrap**, with no host home,
credentials, network or other processes. Inputs are read-only; only one bounded
CSV is writable. CPU, memory, output and execution time are limited. Nothing is
installed automatically. If working isolation is unavailable, choose another
review method. The endpoint still owns LLM hardware and inference. Temporary
files are removed on completion or cancellation.

Progress counts each mapped source word once across the two passes. A failed
region leaves unseen words unchanged, preserves validated entries and continues
with later regions. Retry remaining suspect/failed words or edit them manually.
**LLM responses** also shows the actual code/tool calls, bounded tool output and
reasoning supplied by the endpoint. Reasoning support is requested through
Unsloth's API; other compatible endpoints use their model's default reasoning.
This may be slower than sentence review and does not guarantee better accuracy.

## Use an external chatbot

All three review methods also work by copy and paste, without configuring an
endpoint. In the Browser transcript review, expand **Use an external chatbot ·
copy & paste**, choose **Suspect words**, **Whole text** or **Reasoning
workspace**, and press **Prepare external prompt**.

Press **Copy review prompt** and paste it into the chatbot you choose. Bring
its answer back to the labeled answer box and press **Import answer into
review**. Sentence methods ask for complete sentences with the supplied labels;
the workspace method asks for proposals CSV with exact source IDs and original
spans. Parseh checks the answer before offering edits. A pasted answer is never
executed as code. **LLM responses** also shows imported answers for inspection.

For **Reasoning workspace**, **Download transcript & CSV workspace** supplies a
ZIP containing the entire blanked transcript without timestamps, current-batch
evidence, source IDs, the skill and Python helper. Attach it to a chatbot with
file/code tools and use the copied prompt. Extract it with `parseh-review` as
the working directory. Its `review.py` helper can check edits as work proceeds
with `review.check()`. Before returning the CSV, run
`python review.py --check --complete`: it reports invalid spans, overlapping
edits, punctuation changes and missing required entries. These checks protect
the transcript structure; you still review whether the proposed words are right.
Paste the resulting proposals CSV back. A chatbot
without file tools can use the current-region evidence included in the prompt.
This external route does not require bubblewrap on the Parseh host: any code
tools run in the external service's environment.

Long transcripts use several bounded prompts. Progress counts source words
in imported batches. **Previous prompt** and **Next prompt** let you revisit
a batch; importing it again replaces that batch's proposals. A malformed
answer leaves previously imported batches and the answer box intact. Missing
or invalid sentences remain unchanged and can be retried. **Review received
suggestions** finishes with the answers received so far, marking unanswered
words for retry or keyboard edits. **Cancel external review** returns to the
review choice with the Whisper result intact. Use **Save & pause** to retain the pending review on disk and reopen it from
Videos, including after a server restart.

Accept/reject and manual edits use the same pending draft as API review. Only
**Use this transcript** fills the existing transcript box, with the same
overwrite and stale-source guards. Endpoint calls and model loading do not
occur in this route. You send the text to an external service yourself when
you paste the prompt or attach the ZIP; choose a destination you are comfortable
sharing that text with. Prompts and downloads contain no audio, host paths,
video IDs, endpoint credentials or unrelated history. The last four pasted answer drafts are saved with the pending review on the
Parseh host; they are not stored in browser preferences or sync.

## Correction skill

Expand **Correction skill** in the review page to download the suspect-word
skill (`parseh-asr-correction`), whole-text skill (`parseh-asr-audit`), or the
reasoning workspace skill (`parseh-asr-workspace`). Each zip
contains its skill folder and `SKILL.md`. In Unsloth, extract the folder under the endpoint user's
`.agents/skills/`, or create the skill in Studio and enable it. It can then be
selected with `@parseh-asr-correction` in a Studio chat.

For API review, select **Unsloth Agent Skills + compatible text** as the saved
adapter on the host. **Install in saved endpoint** creates this exact skill
through Unsloth's authenticated Skills API; it never overwrites an existing
skill. **Check installed skill** checks whether it is enabled and valid.
Choose which skill to check/install and enable **Use installed skill for the
chosen review** before starting LLM review. Parseh
sends the skill invocation and sentence evidence; Unsloth loads the installed
instructions with its `read_skill` tool. Other tools and MCP are disabled.

Workspace review always loads its bundled workspace skill and supplies Python
tools; the installed-skill checkbox applies to the two sentence methods. A
downloaded workspace skill also needs its own file/code tools when used outside
Parseh.

Other software needs its own skill-capable API to invoke installed skills.
Generic compatible endpoints use Parseh's short prompt. A skill supplies reusable
instructions to the same model; it does not train it or ensure better accuracy.

## Progress, failures and diagnosis

Progress counts ASR words processed, including failed attempts, rather than
sentences. Whole-text review counts every mapped word; suspect review counts
selected low-score words and dictionary misses. If one request times out or returns an invalid answer, its words stay
unchanged and the remaining sentences continue. Failed and unresolved words can
be edited manually or sent again with **Retry all remaining suspect words**.
Manual edits remain in the draft. Suspect-word retry excludes accepted words.
Whole-text retry rechecks the affected captions; an acceptance is retained only
when its exact proposal is unchanged. Neither route changes the transcript box.

**LLM responses** shows actual prompts, raw/final answers, supplied reasoning,
finish status and elapsed time. Output-limit failures are visible here. Long
outputs/history are bounded and may be clipped. These records remain temporary
with this job; they are never written to logs or synced. A model leaving a word
unchanged does not establish that it is correct.

**Cancel LLM review** aborts the HTTP work and retains the Whisper result.
Audio, waveforms, host file paths, video IDs, cookies and unrelated history are never sent.
ASR hardware remains in Speech to text; LLM hardware belongs to the endpoint.
This feature adds no mobile reader or mobile app behavior.
