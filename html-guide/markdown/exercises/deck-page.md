description: Browsing a deck — its counts and buttons, the list of its exercises, the filters, and what each exercise's own buttons do.
---

**Browse** on a deck's card, or the deck's name, opens the deck's page. The
top of it is the deck; below is every exercise it holds.

![A deck's page: the deck's head, the filters, three exercises selected](shots/deck.png)

## The deck's head

- **The name**, with **✎** beside it to rename the deck, and the deck's
  language.
- **The counts**: `8 exercises · 3 new · 2 learning · 3 in review` — every
  exercise the deck holds, by where it stands (*learning* counts the ones
  relearning after a lapse too).
- **To study now**, the same three coloured numbers as on
  [the decks page](decks-page.md#a-decks-card) — or, when nothing is due,
  when the next exercise is.

And its buttons:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Study now** | [Studies](studying.md) what is due. Dimmed when nothing is. |
| **Add exercise…** | The exercise form, to write an exercise straight into the deck ([more](filling-a-deck.md#in-the-deck-add-exercise)). |
| **Export ▾** | **With scheduling** or **Without scheduling**: the deck as a zip ([more](export-import-backup.md#exporting-a-deck)). |
| **Options…** | Daily limits, learning steps and intervals: [Deck options](options.md). |
| **Delete deck…** | Moves the deck to `exercises/.trash/`, after asking. |

**← All decks** in the top bar goes back to the decks page. At the bar's right end,
**◐** turns the colours and **⚙ page** opens the page's panel — the text sizes, the
exercise switches **Hide transliterations** and **Drag to answer**, the zoom
([The ⚙ settings of a page](../getting-started/page-settings.md#an-exercise-decks-gear)).

### Renaming a deck

**✎** asks for the new name — *Only the name changes: the deck's address,
exercises and scheduling stay.* The deck's address is made from its first
name and never changes, so a bookmark of the deck, or of its study page,
keeps working after a rename.

### Deleting a deck

**Delete deck…** says what will happen before it happens: *Its 8 exercises
and their scheduling are moved to exercises/.trash/ in the Parseh folder, not
erased: move the folder back to restore the deck.* **Delete deck** does it
and takes you back to the decks page. In the trash the deck's folder is
named after its language, its address and the moment it was deleted —
`persian--everyday-persian--20260921-143012` — and moving it back to
`exercises/persian/everyday-persian` restores it whole.

## The list

Each exercise is a row, in the order they were added:

- **What kind it is** — *Flashcard*, *Choose one answer*, *Match
  translations* … — and, for one that no longer works, a red **needs
  attention**; point at it to read why.
- **Its opening words**: the prompt, a card's front, or the first answer.
- **Where it stands**: `new`, `learning`, `relearning` or `review`, then
  when it is due — `not studied yet`, `due now`, `due in 7m`, `due
  tomorrow`, `due in 4d`.
- **Its history**: `2 reviews · 0 lapses` — how many times you answered it,
  and how many times you forgot it once it was a review.
- **Where it came from**: *from* and the document it was copied from, linked
  (or the note beside a book or a video); *from* and the book or the video
  a card was made in, with the place — its link opens the reader at that
  paragraph, or the player at that second; *written here* for an exercise
  added on this page; and a copy made with **Duplicate** says so, *(a
  duplicate)*.
- **Its tags**: `Tags: food, lesson-1`.
- **Whether it is one side of a pair**: a flashcard added as **Both
  (repeat)** goes in as two cards, and each row says `↔ linked · front
  first` or `↔ linked · back first` — the two rows read alike, and this is
  what tells them apart. See [A card with another side](#linked-cards).

**Click a row** to see the exercise drawn **solved** under it — the right
answers marked, the explanations shown, a flashcard's front and back side by
side; click it again to close it. Several can be open at once. The
buttons, the links and the checkbox of a row keep their own clicks, and
Shift with a click selects instead (see
[Selecting many exercises](selecting.md)).

## Finding exercises: the filters

The bar above the list narrows it:

| Filter | What it keeps |
|---|---|
| **Filter the exercises by their text…** | exercises whose text or markdown holds what you type, whatever its case |
| **All types** | one kind of exercise; each kind is listed with how many there are, `Flashcard (2)` |
| **Any state** | **New**, **Learning** (relearning included), **Review**, or **Due now**: the reviews and learning steps due at this moment |
| **All tags** | the exercises with one tag, `food (4)` |
| **Sources** | one or more places the exercises came from: a markdown document, a book, a video, or **Written here**; every checkbox says how many matching exercises it has |

They work together, and the count at the end of the bar says how many rows
are left: `3 of 8`, or `8 exercises` with no filter on. When nothing
matches, the list says *No exercise matches these filters.*

Open **Sources** to tick any number of sources. Ticked sources are alternatives
to one another, while the source result is still combined with the text, type,
state and tag filters. Its choices and counts follow those other filters, so an
unselected source with no matching exercise is not shown. A checked source
stays at `0` until you untick it, rather than silently turning that part of the
filter off. A document source keeps the name saved on its exercises, so it is
still useful if that document is renamed or later removed.

**Due now** leaves out the new exercises (they are under **New**); a review
counts as due for the whole of the day it falls on, and a learning step from
the minute it falls due. An exercise whose markdown is no longer an exercise
at all is listed under the type **Unreadable**.

## Each exercise's own buttons

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Edit** | Opens the exercise in the form, as the editor does; **Save exercise** saves it. On one side of a pair it may ask about the other ([below](#linked-cards)). |
| **Duplicate** | Adds a copy of it, which starts as new: *Duplicated: the copy starts as new*. The copy is linked with nothing, whatever the original is. |
| **Copy to deck…** | Copies it into another deck of the same language ([more](selecting.md#copying-and-moving-to-another-deck)). |
| **Move to deck…** | Moves it there, with its schedule. |
| **Delete** | Removes it, and its history, for good. On one side of a pair it asks about the other ([below](#linked-cards)). |

**Edit keeps the schedule.** Correcting a typo does not make an exercise new
again, and does not change where it came from: the schedule belongs to
you, not to the words. An exercise the form cannot show — one that needs
attention, say — opens as its markdown instead (*Edit the exercise as
markdown*), so it can still be put right from here. If the edited exercise
names a picture or a recording the deck does not have, it is saved all the
same, and the message says which file is missing.

**Delete** asks first — *“Match the words.” and its scheduling (1 review)
leave the deck for good* — and then **Delete exercise**. Unlike a
deck, a deleted exercise does not go to the trash.

## A card with another side {#linked-cards}

A flashcard whose **Which side appears first** is **Both (repeat)** goes
into a deck as **two cards**: one that shows the front first and one that
shows the back first, so each direction is learned and scheduled on its
own. The two are **linked**, and Browse marks both rows (`↔ linked · front
first`, `↔ linked · back first`). The front-first card is listed before the
back-first one.

Linking has one rule: **you are asked before a change or a deletion leaves
the other side as it was.** Saving a change to one of the two puts this
question over the form:

- **Change both cards** writes the change to the other side too. Each card
  keeps the side it shows first, and neither one's schedule is touched.
- **Change only this one (unlink them)** changes this card alone, and the
  two are linked no more.
- **Cancel** leaves both as they were, and the form stays open.

**Delete** asks the same way — **Delete both**, **Delete only this (the
other stays, unlinked)** or **Cancel** — and so does **Delete** on a
[selection](selecting.md#delete) that holds one side of a pair without the
other. A save that changes nothing — the same words, written differently —
asks nothing, and neither does a change to a card that has no other side.

A few things are never shared between the two: **tags**, **schedules**
and **Set to new** are each card's own, and the side a card shows first is
what makes the pair, so in the form of one of two linked cards that choice
is fixed (*This card is one side of a pair: its side is fixed.*); unlink
them with **Change only this one**, and it can be changed. **Both
(repeat)** is how a card is added, so it is not offered when editing a card
that is already in the deck; **Both (random)**, which draws a face each
time the card comes up, can be chosen there.

## An empty deck

A deck with no exercises says how to fill one: **Add exercise…** above, or
**+ Deck** beside an exercise on a [studio document](filling-a-deck.md) in
the deck's language; the readers of books and the players of videos add the
cards made there, with their recordings.
