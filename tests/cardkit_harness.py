"""The toolbox tests/cardkit.mjs drives: the REAL hub (serve.main) on a
temporary tree, with a narrated book and a film whose sound can be measured.

    python3 tests/cardkit_harness.py build <tmp>
        makes <tmp>/root: books/english/mini-en (the fixture) with a narration
        and its timings, the reader built, and audio/slow.wav (below);
        youtube/videos/english/<id> with a media.mp4.  Prints one line of JSON
        saying what is where.
    python3 tests/cardkit_harness.py serve <tmp> <port> [--no-ffmpeg] [--tray <name>]
        serve.main() on 127.0.0.1:<port> over <tmp>/root, the studio library,
        the exercise decks, the Anki store with its sync inbox and the clip
        tray (<tmp>/<name>, default tray) all inside <tmp>.  --no-ffmpeg makes the machine one
        without ffmpeg (audiofile.ffmpeg answers None), so the cut routes
        answer 409 {record: true} and the page records the clip itself.

THE SOUND IS A PATTERN, so a cut is measurable: a 440 Hz tone for 0.6 s at
every whole second from 1 to 7, silence between -- a clip [1.8, 3.3] starts
0.2 s before a tone and a clip that starts late or early says so by where its
first tone begins.  audio/slow.wav holds a tone at every whole second for
45 s, uncompressed, for the page to record under a throttled connection.
Never touches the real books/, clips/, exercises/ or markdown/library/.
