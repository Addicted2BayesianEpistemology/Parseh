"""The toolbox, end to end, for every language it teaches.

    python3 tests/smoke.py            everything that needs no TeX engine
    python3 tests/smoke.py --pdf      ... and the LaTeX builds (minutes)
    python3 tests/smoke.py --only books,videos,draft,studio,anki,server,js,verbs

What it proves, in order:

  compile   every Python file compiles; every page script parses (deno, when
            the conda environment has it)
  registry  lib/languages.py lists the languages, the original four leading
  books     the fixture editions under tests/fixtures/books/, and any book
            the owner keeps under books/ (the shelf ships empty): texparse
            reads them, tex2html writes a reader with
            the language's passes (ruby + kana + a vertical pass for
            Japanese, two passes for the Latin-script ones, Arabic digits for
            Arabic), verify_book.py proves fidelity, check_batch.py and
            assemble.py accept a paragraph rebuilt from the .tex (and write
            \\chr for Japanese), texwrite.py numbers the chunks as texparse
            does and edits one of them in a copy without moving another byte,
            bundle.py takes each edition out as one file and puts it back into
            a scratch toolbox byte for byte (and refuses a zip that tries to
            write outside it) and takes a narrated one out in each of its
            three shapes -- `text` leaving nothing that points at a recording,
            `linked` plus audio/ being `full` file for file, and a `text`
            bundle landing on a narrated book costing nobody the recording;
            make_index.py writes the library page with the
            chip row; with --pdf, every fixture builds with lualatex under
            build.sh's own criteria, and build.sh itself is run when there is
            a book on the shelf for it to build
  videos    check_annotations.py on every fixture (merged in a temporary
            copy) and on whatever is under youtube/videos/, which ships empty
            too; ytpages assembles the index and -- with each fixture parked
            briefly under youtube/videos/ -- every language's player, and a
            video actually filed there gets its channel and player page as
            well; the annotator's prompt builds for every language in the
            registry; and
            bundle.py round-trips every video and refuses one whose
            annotations no longer check
  draft     lib/draft.py makes an empty edition out of each fixture's own
            text and an empty annotation out of each fixture video's
            transcript, and marks neither of them as anything: the draft
            reproduces its source, passes check_batch and check_annotations
            with one count note instead of errors (a blank chunk is legal
            everywhere), and renders -- and a chunk half written in it, its
            meaning typed and its reading blanked, is refused; an old
            "draft": true left in book.json or video.json changes nothing
  studio    every starter opens, marks its runs the way its script asks and
            numbers them as the store does; the prose table and the registry
            name one set of hyphenation patterns per language; every document
            in exlex/examples/ and tests/fixtures/studio/ renders through
            htmlgen and texgen with the target its own front matter declares
            (a Japanese one, when there is one, showing a vertical block,
            kana marks and a lemma reading); whatever documents the library
            holds carry their target; every language without a document of
            its own goes through both renderers as one built from its fixture
            edition's first chunk; with --pdf every one of those documents
            builds and verifies, the Persian fixture still at 186/186 and the
            feature test -- figures, footnotes, links, colour and blocks
            through XeLaTeX -- at 21/21
  verbs     the \\vb a dictionary hit carries: every language's recipe
            (lib/verbs/<code>.py) on its own eight cases under
            tests/fixtures/verbs/, each built into a dictionary of one entry
            -- so no dictionary need be installed -- and the core that writes
            the four shapes of one verb from what a recipe says, held to the
            PDF's macro and to both readers' reading of it
  anki      the round trip in tests/fixtures/anki/roundtrip.py (the deck store,
            one deck per language, the builds and the .apkg round trip)
  server    serve.py, started on a spare port over plain http, answers every
            door's pages and the new routes without a traceback

And after all of it, whatever --only chose: config/ beside the checkout --
the owner's preferences and the phone-keeping door's memories -- is byte for
byte as the run found it (tests/configguard.py), or the run fails.

books/, youtube/videos/ and the studio's library ship empty: what goes in
them is the owner's, not the software's.  So every one of them is tried when
something is there and skipped, by name, when nothing is -- the suite is
green on a fresh clone and says more on a full one.

Fixtures live under tests/fixtures/; nothing here writes under books/,
youtube/videos/ or the studio library except the readers of a book already
on the shelf (which build.sh rewrites anyway) -- and a fixture video is
copied under youtube/videos/<folder>/ only for the seconds its player page
is assembled, then removed.  The one thing that does stay is the server's own
first start, which test_server performs: serve.py seeds whatever example
documents exlex/examples/ holds into markdown/library/ -- none, at present --
exactly as it would for somebody opening the studio for the first time.  Standard library only; the LaTeX builds and
the JS parse use what is on the machine and say so when it is absent.

Nothing here counts languages by hand: the registry says how many there are,
and a language the fixtures do not cover yet is a SKIP naming the door it
misses, never a failure -- adding a language must not turn the suite red
before its fixtures are written (docs/languages.md section 10).

def test_draft():
    """lib/draft.py: an empty book and an empty video, for every language.

    The text of each draft is the fixture edition's own source, so the draft
    is a book whose finished twin is sitting beside it; a language whose
    fixtures are not written yet is a skip, as everywhere else here.  What is
    proved is what makes the feature real: the draft passes its own checker,
    reproduces its source, and renders -- and a chunk half written in it
    fails.

    Nothing marks a draft as one.  A chunk nobody has glossed yet is legal in
    every book and every video, so the draft is an ordinary edition whose
    chunks are all blank: book.json and video.json carry no "draft" key, each
    checker passes it with ONE count note ("N of M chunks have no gloss
    yet") and no error, and a "draft": true an older version left behind in
    book.json or video.json is never read -- the checkers say exactly what
    they say without it.  The half-written chunk is a real one: its meaning
    typed and the reading the draft proposed from its words blanked, so it
    lacks a field its language requires in every language that requires one
    (a reading proposed from the words is no gloss while the chunk is blank,
    and counts as the reading it is once anything else is written).

def test_divide():
    """lib/chunkdiv.py and the two writers: where a chunk ends, moved.

    The strongest thing that can be said about surgery on a file is that it
    can be undone, so most of this is a round trip: join the first two chunks
    of every fixture edition and every fixture video, cut the result back at
    the seam they were joined on, and require the file to be the file it was
    BYTE FOR BYTE -- the .tex with its indentation and its line endings, the
    .json with its own indent and its own key order.  A merge that dropped a
    field, a split that reflowed a line or a writer that normalised something
    on the way past would all show up as a difference here and nowhere else.

    Then the refusals, which are the other half of the feature: a chunk is
    divided at the places its language divides and nowhere else, and both
    writers say so in words rather than writing a file the checkers will
    reject afterwards.  What neither refuses is the gloss a cut leaves: a
    half left with no meaning is written, half glossed, for the chunk sheet
    to finish, and a chunk nobody has glossed yet divides in any book and any
    video into two blank halves -- in a language divided into words, each
    proposed the reading of its own words.
