// temporary toolbox: the fixture editions of English (narrated), Persian,
// Arabic, Japanese, Hindi and Chinese with their readers built, the Italian one
// never built, and three exercise decks.  Measured where the page is drawn -- computed
// display, bounding rects, elementFromPoint -- on a phone held upright (390x844
// and 360x740, touch, Chromium's device emulation), on one held sideways
// (844x390, touch), and on a desktop with a mouse:
//
// shelf -- the book shelf, /m/books/:
//   a) the mobile hub's Books door, tapped, lands on /m/books/ (the browser
//      hub's lands on the library, /books/); a ctrl-click too, in a new tab;
//      sideways, the hub's doors two to a row
//   b) all there is to tap: home, the switch, the theme, the chips and one card
//      per built book, each 48px high at the least, inside the screen and
//      reached by a tap on it; the book never built says so and is no link; no
//      delete, no build, no bundle, no stop; the page never scrolls sideways;
//      sideways, the books two to a row
//   c) a chip shows its language's books and heading alone (the shelf holds
//      Persian, Arabic, Italian unbuilt, Japanese, English, Hindi, Chinese)
//   d) a book read on this phone says how far ("read on"), and its card opens
//      the reader at the address the place was kept under
//   e) Browser, pressed on the shelf, goes to the library; the shelf opened in
//      the browser mode says what it is and where the library is
// reader -- a book's reader, in the mobile mode (lib/mobilereader.js):
//   a) opened from the shelf; its header: the way out (hub, shelf), the
//      contents, the text size and ⋯ -- and on a narrated book ↺ ▶ ↻, on a
//      line of their own upright and on the one line sideways -- each 48px at
//      the least, on the screen; nothing else of the header drawn, and none of
//      the page's writing doors -- book info, the builds, the narration,
//      folding, timings, stop, download, the dictionary setup, the pencil, a
//      note's plus
//   b) ⋯ opens the rest, a group to a line: the passes, the listening (only a
//      narrated book), this page (the theme, the bars, the switch); the passes
//      still hide their pass; the theme still turns; sideways, the header
//      never taller than the screen
//   c) the contents opens, without its naming; the gloss cloud opens on a tap
//      in hover mode, with copy and without card or edit
//   d) on a desktop in the mobile mode, alt-click on a word opens no card
//      sheet and E no chunk editor -- both of which they open in the browser
//      mode, measured on the same page
//   e) play plays, and the shelf's ▤ goes to the mobile shelf
//   f) Browser, pressed, gives the reader back its browser header, the same
//      controls as it had before Mobile was pressed
//   g) ↻ and ↺ move the recording by the seconds the Listening group's field
//      says, and the reading place with it; the field keeps its number for
//      every book, and refuses nonsense; sideways, the header goes on the
//      way down and comes back on the way up, and stays while ⋯ is open
// decks -- the exercise decks, /exercises/ (markdown/app, static/mobile.css):
//   a) the mobile hub's Exercises door lands on the decks' mobile layout, the
//      browser bar display:none; all there is to tap: home, the switch, the
//      theme, the chips, and a deck's name, Study and Open -- no import,
//      backup, restore, new deck, stop, ⋯ -- each 48px at the least
//   b) a chip filters the decks; the theme button turns the page dark
//   c) a deck: its counts, Study now and Cram all, and its exercises to pick
//      from -- the filters, all, shown, by tag, none -- and no rename, add,
//      export, options, delete, nor anything in the list that changes an
//      exercise; an empty deck says where exercises are added
//   d) studying: no bar over the exercise, no Edit, no key hints, no stop; ‹
//      back to the deck; Show answer or Check, then Next in the very same
//      place and the four ratings with their intervals -- a bar at the foot
//      upright, a column down the right sideways; Next and Good schedule the
//      exercise (the deck's own file says so); a choice answered right says
//      Correct
//   e) Cram all crams every exercise of the deck, the scheduling as it was; two
//      picked by hand are crammed, and so are the ones a tag picks
//   f) Browser, pressed, brings back every control of the browser layout
// app -- the mobile interface as an app (lib/mobile.py, lib/sw.js):
//   a) the app's address, /?mode=mobile, sets the mode and is given back
//      without it; the hub, the shelf, a reader and the decks are installable
//      as Chromium judges it (the one thing it has against them is the test's
//      own incognito profile), the worker taking the pages over
//   a2) the app gets itself ready AFTER it is installed, and says so: the page
//      asks for the way in by itself, the hub counts the addresses as they
//      come ("Getting ready — 41 of 46") and says nothing once it is done --
//      and the studio's faces are on no phone that has only installed the app;
//      the line stands at the FOOT, so its coming and going moves no door
//   a3) a note opened is what fetches them, all thirteen
//   b) the install page says this phone trusts Parseh, and says when the
//      waiting it asked for is over; the hub has its door
//   c) the server stopped, a page opened says Parseh cannot be reached
// update -- Parseh updated on the computer (TO-DO §13.16): a book and a video
//   kept, the hub back as another release with two shared scripts changed;
//   the app takes the new worker and says so in a line, reloading nothing;
//   the kept caches survive; renew mends every copy; the keep check says
//   "updated" and never "no longer whole" for them, and still catches a copy
//   really broken; both still open with the computer away

     believes what the page before it found (lib/keep.js writes the memory

// its recording -- with a range asked of it, which is what makes ↺ and ↻ work
// on a train -- the chip that says the computer cannot be reached, what has
// no answer offline saying so at once, and the list of what is kept.
//
// AND ITS NOTES, which are the whole of the owner's second block of
// 2026-09-23: a kept book used to keep its text and its recordings and leave
// every note he had written on the computer, so every seam on a train opened
// on nothing.  Two books are kept here for that -- the English one WITH its
// notes ticked and the Persian one with them UNTICKED -- because a tick that
// cannot be taken off is not a tick, and the honest answer where they were
// not kept is as much a promise as the note where they were.
//
// AND FOUR THINGS FROM HIS THIRD BLOCK, all of them found in airplane mode on
// his own phone and none of them findable by reading the source:
//   a4) every address the built reader asks for is in the record.  One was
//       not -- /lib/mt.js, a parser-blocking script in the reader's head --
//       and the page stopped on it and never reached its text: "all books do
//       not open while offline, loading stops at ~half".
//   b0) what a recording's row says (the chapter and the section first, the
//       paragraph addresses under them) and the shape of it (four fifths of
//       the width, against the left, 48px still, and the drag still selects).
//   b1a) a tick that is a lie: the kept recording is damaged in the cache,
//       byte for byte the same size, and the sheet must untick it and say so.
//   b5) the state is carried from page to page and corrected by the probe.

/* THE PHONE MEETS TWO PARSEHS.  Everything else in this file meets one; the
   owner's promise about an update is about the moment the phone meets the
   next.  A book and a video are kept from the first release, the hub is
   stopped, and it comes back as ANOTHER RELEASE: another version in its
   Server header and in the worker it serves (PARSEH_TEST_VERSION,
   tests/mobile_harness.py), and two of lib/'s shared scripts changed as a
   release changes them -- parseh.js, which the reader loads, and
   mobileplayer.js, which a reader never does, so one copy is renewed by the
   visit and the other is not.  What he asked for, each driven here:

     - the app takes the new worker by itself, and SAYS in one line that
       Parseh was updated -- never a silent swap, and nothing reloaded;
     - activate keeps `parseh-kept-*` and `parseh-shared`;
     - `renew` mends the shared copy on the next online visit -- every copy
       of it, the way in's too;
     - the keep check calls what Parseh changed "updated", writes down the
       digest the copy really has, fetches nothing for it, and never calls it
       "no longer whole" -- while a copy that really is broken is still caught
       and mended;
     - the kept book and video still open with the computer away. */
