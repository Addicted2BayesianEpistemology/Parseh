"""What every language's starter shows (markdown/exlex/starters/<code>.md).

    python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_starters.py

A new document opens on its language's starter, and the starter is a tour of
the whole dialect: each thing a note can do, done once on real examples, so
that a new user learns it by reading the page and its source side by side.
A thing the dialect documents and no starter shows is one nobody meets, and
a thing only some languages show is one their users alone meet -- so each
of these is asked of every starter, from the markdown it is written in to
the page htmlgen draws of it.  (smoke.py asks the rest: that each starter
declares its language, marks its runs as its script asks, and numbers them
as the store does; test_starter_media.py that every file one names ships.)
