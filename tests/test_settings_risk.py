"""Who may change what, and the reading help's home in Settings (TO-DO §11.10).

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_settings_risk.py

WHO MAY SAVE IS A PROPERTY OF THE SETTING (the owner, 2026-09-24): one table
in lib/settingspage.py names every setting, and for each risky one the part
of the sentence it trips -- "a setting is risky when it changes who may
reach Parseh, what Parseh exposes, or what Parseh will run".  Here, as tests:

  * the table is complete: every route serve.py answers under /settings/api/
    and /lookup/api/ is in it, and every route in it is answered -- a route
    somebody adds without writing it down fails this file, and is refused
    at run time for everybody;
  * a phone let in over the Wi-Fi is refused a Network change, in the words
    of the setting's own entry, and may get and remove a download;
  * the live pairing code is on the computer's page and not on a phone's;
  * /lookup/ answers with a redirect that keeps the fragment, forever, and
    the API stays where it was;
  * a download reports how far it has got, can be stopped, says what it
    costs before it starts, is refused when the disk has no room, and "get
    everything" runs one step at a time on the server -- all through the job
    tables, with the downloaders stubbed (lib/download.py's interface: build
    and plan, with say, progress and cancel).

The real server, over plain http on a free port, with the dictionaries,
corpora, models and packs pointed at a temporary folder and the network
settings with them: nothing here writes the checkout's dict/ or config/.
