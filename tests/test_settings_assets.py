"""Every page of Settings finds the stylesheets, scripts and pages it names.

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_settings_assets.py

A page that names `/lib/settings-tools.css` and a server that does not send it
is a page drawn with the browser's own controls: no spacing between the links
of its foot, white boxes in its forms (a0.4.3's LLM Integration, LM likelihood
and About, found by the owner on 2026-10-05).  The file was in the tree and in
git; only the list of what the server may send (serve.STATIC_FILES) did not
name it.  The same for a link: the two "Setup help" links of LLM Integration and
LM likelihood went to /guide/lookup-and-languages/..., and the guide's pages are
under /guide/site/.  So this asks the way a browser does: the real server, over
http, for every Settings page and then for every address on this computer that
each one names (a stylesheet, a script, a link; never an API route, which is
asked by a POST and not by a click).
