"""EVERY SCRIPT THAT STARTS THE CHECKOUT'S OWN SERVER POINTS EVERY STORE OF config/ AT ITS TEMPORARY TREE.

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_harness_stores.py

config/ beside the checkout is the owner's own (tests/configguard.py says
what is in it).  The same fault has now been found three times: a suite left
his theme dark; two unit modules went on writing digests.json and wheres.json;
and in a0.5.0 the harnesses behind tests/your_prompts.mjs and
tests/speech_door.mjs wrote his theme into prefs.json again, because the
studio's pages had started to save it (lib/prefs.js) and nobody had told the
two harnesses, which pointed the stores they had thought of and not that one.
Each time a store was redirected in the harness that had leaked and in no
other.  What was missing was a thing that asks, of every harness, about every
store.

WHAT IT DOES.  It reads the files and runs nothing.  The stores are FOUND in
lib/, not listed here (a constant of a module whose path is under "config"
and ends ".json", and a constant that is another module's store by another
name, as newlang.PERSONAL is languages.PERSONAL), so that a store added next
year is asked of every harness the day it is added, and the failure says
the line to put in.  Every script of tests/ that starts the server (it
imports `serve`, or imports one that does) must be named in HARNESSES below.
One that starts the server itself must assign or patch each store; one that
hands the serving to another harness must import it, and that one must do the
assigning.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO.  It does not see a store whose path a function works
out from a root it is handed (lib/llmconfig.py, lib/updater.py): there is no
constant to point elsewhere.  And it cannot tell that a harness runs before
the server does.  What watches those are the guard around the unit suite
(tests/test_config_untouched.py), the one smoke.py has, and the one release
step 1 puts around the loop of browser suites (tests/configguard.py save and
check): a look at what changed, where this is a look at what was written.
