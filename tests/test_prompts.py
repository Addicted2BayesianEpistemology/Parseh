"""The prompt tests (brief 3.8): every prompt Parseh hands to a chatbot, in every
language of the registry and in one added with lib/newlang.py, as a chatbot
receives it -- built by the lab (lib/promptlab.py), which builds each one the
way its own page does -- and the kit that makes them (lib/promptkit.py).

Three things are held here:

  * THE KIT: the marks of a template ({{?flag}} blocks, {{NAME}} placeholders),
    a template's three parts, what a person's own instructions may and may not
    do, the version line, the cut of a language's conventions;
  * THE PROMPTS: a table of checks (CHECKS) run over every surface x language x
    mode -- no `{{` left, the language named, a size budget, the parts in their
    order, and the drift the owner has met: a book's rules in a video's prompt, a
    correction sent to `note`, a harakat rule in the studio's;
  * THE ASSEMBLERS: every route that hands out a prompt keeps its shape and hands
    out what the kit made.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT PASS YET is a row marked PENDING("D") or PENDING("E"): the
lane that rewrites the words it is about (D: the gloss prompts and the
language files, E: the studio's) makes it true and takes the mark off.  A row
never silently disappears: while it is pending it is a skipped test that names
its lane, says why and says how many prompts still fail it -- and the day it
passes on all of them it fails, until the mark is taken off.

# measured size with 15 % to spare, rounded up to a hundred.  A region prompt is
# its largest mode.  One table, so that a lane that makes a prompt longer or
# shorter does it on purpose: change the measured number and its budget together
# (test_the_budgets_keep_to_their_rule) and say why in the commit.  What a
# person's own text or a language they added adds is theirs; these are Parseh's.

# the exercise prompt for a page that uses no feature yet, every type ticked

# THE RESERVED LIST, DRIVEN.  Every construct the studio reads that the prompt names -- in its box when the
# box is ticked, in the reserved list at the end of the prompt when it is not -- with the sample line that
# makes it, read here by the real parser (mdparser for the blocks, htmlgen for the page).  The rows were
# driven by hand in Phase 0 (a0.4.2's research: 121 of them, four of the brief's starter's own wrong: a
# table's separator needs pipes, a `|` in a heading is an entry only in the script targets when the first
# field is in the script, bold is not barred from target-language words, a code fence's inside is READ).
#   id  box that teaches it, or "always"  target  the sample  its blocks  its blocks as the middle line of
#   a wrapped paragraph  what the page shows  its words in the box  its words in the reserved list  [document]
# A row whose reserved-list words are None is a detail of its box only.  `{CODE}` is the target's own code.
