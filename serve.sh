#   ./serve.sh              start it and print the addresses
#   ./serve.sh 9000         ... on another port (default 8765)
#   ./serve.sh stop         stop it
#   ./serve.sh status       is it running, and where
#   ./serve.sh log          follow the log
#   ./serve.sh restart      stop, then start again
#   ./serve.sh cert         make the server's certificate afresh (.tls/),
#                           e.g. after the machine's addresses changed; the
#                           authority a phone was told to trust stays
#
# Everything -- the book reader, the video player, the studio, the exercise
# decks, the Anki store -- is served by serve.py at ONE https address:
#
#   https://localhost:8765/          (and the Tailscale / LAN addresses it prints)
#
# The certificate is made by serve.py itself on first start, signed by an
# authority of this machine's own (docs/mobile.md, "Parseh as an app").
# Every browser warns once about it; accept, and it never asks again -- or
# tell a phone to trust the authority, from the mobile hub's "As an app",
# and it never warns at all.  It is our own server on our own network.
#
# `python3 serve.py &` is not enough, and the way it fails is nasty: the job
# keeps the terminal as its stdout and stderr.  Close that terminal, or let the
# shell exit, and every write to them raises -- so the endpoints that log
# (which are exactly the POSTs: saving times, and the stop-server button)
# started failing while plain page loads carried on working.  serve.py no
# longer lets a log line break a request, but a background job still wants a
# session of its own and a real file to write to, which is what this does:
#
#   setsid       a new session, so closing the terminal cannot HUP it
#   < /dev/null  nothing to read, so it can never be stopped for reading the tty
#   >> log 2>&1  both streams land in a file that is always writable
#
# macOS has no setsid(1) -- it is a util-linux tool -- but setsid(2) is POSIX,
# and Python, which is about to run anyway, exposes it: os.setsid() and then
# exec serve.py is exactly what the command does.  Nor has macOS a /proc, so
# "is this pid our server" is asked of ps there.  That is the whole of the
# difference between the two systems; on Linux nothing here changed.
