"""Who may reach this Parseh, and on which port (TO-DO §1.1, §3.3, §3.4, and
the owner's decisions of 2026-09-23).

Parseh is one person's toolbox on one person's computer, and every route in
it can delete a book, overwrite an edition or stop the server.  Until today
it bound every interface and asked nobody who they were: anybody on the same
Wi-Fi could do all three.  What follows is the door, and it is a door with
three positions rather than a lock:

  * **this computer** -- always, and never asked anything.  With both doors
    below shut this is not a rule but a closed socket: the server binds
    127.0.0.1 and there is nothing on the network to knock at.
  * **a VPN** -- Tailscale's own range (and any range or name added to
    `extra`), trusted with no ceremony, because a device is on that network
    only if this person's own account put it there.  On by default.
  * **the Wi-Fi** -- shut on a fresh install.  Opened, a device on it still
    has to be LET IN ONCE, by typing a short code shown on the computer;
    then it is remembered by a token in a long-lived cookie.

Anything else -- a public address, somebody who found the port from outside
-- is refused at the socket, before a byte of HTTP is read.

    config/network.json
    {"port": 7654,
     "vpn": true, "lan": false,
     "extra": ["10.8.0.0/24", "laptop.example.ts.net"],
     "cert": {"cert": "/etc/ssl/mine.pem", "key": "/etc/ssl/mine.key"},
     "devices": {"<token>": {"name": "Android phone · Chrome",
                             "at": 1758531600.0, "seen": 1758531600.0,
                             "ip": "192.168.1.20"}}}

THE FILE IS THIS MACHINE'S.  Like `config/prefs.json` beside it, it is in no
bundle and in no backup and it is gitignored: it says who may reach THIS
computer, which means nothing anywhere else, and the tokens in it are as
good as keys.  It is written whole through a temporary file, so a request
reading it while a save is in flight gets the old file or the new one and
never half of either.

THE PAIRING CODE IS NOT IN IT.  A code lives in this process and for
fifteen minutes; it is printed when the server starts and shown on the
Settings page, where a button makes a fresh one.  A code retires the moment
a device uses it -- it lets ONE device in -- and a run of wrong guesses
retires it too, rather than letting a thousand tries a second wear a
six-character code down.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO.  It never binds, never answers a request and
never speaks HTTP: `serve.py` asks it who is knocking (`may_connect`,
`let_in`) and what to bind (`bind_host`, `port`), and writes the page.  That
is what makes it testable without a server (tests/test_network.py).
