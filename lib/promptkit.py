"""One way to assemble every prompt Parseh hands to a chatbot, from three parts.

    assemble(surface, lang, gloss, ...)   -> Assembled: the text and its parts
    parts(surface) / instructions(surface) / contract(surface)

    language_text(surface, lang)          docs/lang/<code>.md cut to what that prompt needs
    version_line(surface, lang, gloss)    "Parseh prompt · video-region · fa → en · a0.4.2"
    placeholders(surface)                 [(NAME, meaning)]: what a template may name
    blocks(text, flags), flat(text), instructions_of(text)
                                          the {{?flag}}...{{/flag}} blocks of a text
    OPTIONS, resolve(surface, lang, asked, facts), describe(...), header_fields(...)
                                          the choices a person makes for ONE prompt: the
                                          scheme of the transliteration (usual or IPA) and the
                                          short vowels (Persian, Arabic)

docs/prompt-kit.md is the guide; this is what it rests on.

A SURFACE is one place a prompt is handed out from (SURFACES: the studio's
page and its exercise dialog, the video and the book from scratch, a stretch
of either to gloss again, the transcript tidy, Ask LLM).  Each has ONE
readable template, and the file is the whole prompt: nothing a person reads
in a prompt is written anywhere else.

THE THREE PARTS, always in this order:

  1. the INSTRUCTIONS -- how to do the job: the rules, the language's
     conventions, the method.  Parseh's, or a person's own (assemble takes
     them as an argument); in a template, everything outside a mark;
  2. the answer CONTRACT -- the shape of the answer and how to send it: one
     fenced block, the JSON, several messages, a caption given twice taken
     from the later block, the studio's file-or-fence.  Always Parseh's, for
     every prompt whose answer Parseh reads back; marked in the template
     with {{?contract}}...{{/contract}};
  3. the DATA -- the captions, the chunks, the page, the question.  Always
     Parseh's, always last; marked {{?data}}...{{/data}} where the template
     holds a frame for it (the caller may also hand the data in whole).

A person's instructions may replace or extend the first and never touch the
other two: that is what lets Parseh check an answer whatever was asked.

BLOCKS AND PLACEHOLDERS.  {{?flag}}...{{/flag}} is kept where the flag is
true and gone where it is not (blocks may hold blocks); {{NAME}} is filled
from what the caller gives.  Both are the same in every template, in the
language files and in a person's own instructions.  THE KIT NEVER HANDS OUT
A PROMPT THAT STILL CARRIES `{{`: that is a template naming what nothing
fills, a bug, and it is refused in words (PromptError) rather than sent to a
chatbot.  A block whose flag the caller never gave is refused the same way,
because a mistyped flag would otherwise take its text out without a word.
The data, and what a caller marks `verbatim`, are never looked into: a
book's title or a caption may say `{{` and be right.  A flag or a placeholder
given `Open(words)` is the one thing resolved NOT here but by whoever reads the
text (lib/skills.py writes a skill once, for every request): it stays as
`⟦if words⟧ … ⟦end words⟧` or `⟨words⟩`.

WHAT THE MARKS COST.  Taking the marks out of a template gives the file as it
was before it was split (flat() does exactly that, for a page that fills a
template itself), so a mark sits against the words it belongs to and never
adds a character that a reader of the prompt would see.
