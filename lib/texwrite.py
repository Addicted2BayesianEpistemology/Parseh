"""Change ONE chunk of a chapter .tex, and leave every other byte alone.

A chapter file is written by hand.  Its comments, its blank lines, the place
where a long \\voc was broken across lines, the \\parstart / \\parnum / frank
scaffolding are the author's, and none of it can be derived from the chunks --
so nothing here ever re-emits a parsed chapter.  edit_chunk finds the one
macro call, replaces only the argument groups that changed, and splices: the
prefix and the suffix are the bytes that were already there.

    read_chunks(path)                every chunk of one chapter, addressable
    edit_chunk(path, index, fields)  rewrite that one chunk, or refuse
    book_chapters(book)              the chapter files and their chunk counts

serve.py wires the routes; these functions are the contract.  A refusal is a
Refused, never a SystemExit -- the command-line tools beside this file exit,
but this one runs inside the server.

THE INDEX is the chunk's ordinal in the file, counting \\ch, \\chr, \\chw,
\\chrw and \\chp from 0 in source order: the order texparse yields, because
that is the number the reader was given (tex2html writes it into data-c) and
the number it hands back.  The two orders must not drift, so the walk below is
texparse.parse_chapter's own, step for step -- the same macro pattern, the
same rule that a % opening a line comments the line out, the same
read_args/read_group for the braces.  It keeps the offsets parse_chapter
throws away and changes nothing else.  (data-c counts across the whole book,
in the order main.tex \\inputs the files; book_chapters turns one of those
numbers into a file and a local index.)

WHAT MAY BE WRITTEN, and why nothing is escaped.  fa, kana, tr and en are set
by LaTeX as literal text, and this file refuses any of \\ { } $ % & # _ ^ ~ in
them rather than escaping them.  That is the one decision here worth arguing,
so: there is no escape that the PDF, the checker and the reader all accept.

  * $ % & # _ ^ ~ and \\\\ are what check_batch.py's BADTEX rejects, and it
    rejects them escaped exactly as it rejects them raw -- \\% in a tr would
    leave the chapter failing the checker that guards it.
  * \\{ and \\} would satisfy LaTeX and read back through read_group, which
    steps over a backslash-escaped brace.  But the reader prints what the
    field says: tex2html html-escapes fa, tr, kana and en and never
    un-escapes LaTeX, so the page would show the backslash.
  * across every edition in this repository -- the Persian book and every
    fixture, in every language -- those four fields contain not one of these
    characters.  Nothing is being taken away.

voc is the exception, and is written through byte for byte: it is LaTeX by
design (\\dw, \\vb, \\bw, \\pw, \\textit, \\emph, \\nobreak, \\,), and escaping
it would destroy the field.  It is validated instead, with check_batch.py's
own ALLOWED, BADTEX and count_args -- imported rather than copied, so an edit
cannot disagree with the checker that judges the file afterwards -- plus one
check check_batch does not make: the braces must balance under read_group's
rule, since a voc that leaves one open would swallow the arguments after it.

WHAT IS NOT TEXT AT ALL is refused in every field, the vocabulary included.
A control character is invisible, and every check downstream looks straight
past it: a NUL posted into an en sits identically on both sides of the
fidelity comparison and passes it, is written into ch1.tex and into
source/paras/, is served raw inside reader/index.html -- a 0x00 going over
the wire -- and stops ./build.sh in LaTeX with a message that names neither
the chapter nor the chunk.  An unpaired surrogate is not a character at all:
UTF-8 cannot encode one, so it would leave a half-written .tex.tmp beside the
chapter and hand the request a traceback where a refusal belongs.  The tab,
the newline and the carriage return are the exception, because they are in
this data already -- a long voc is broken across lines, and a chapter written
on Windows ends every line with a CR.  Nothing else is taken away: every
script the toolbox teaches, the combining marks, the zero-width non-joiner
Persian needs (U+200C, which lib/languages.json lists in chars for fa) and
the studio's return sign are letters and marks, not controls.  lib/draft.py
refuses this same class at the other door and points here for the reason.

THE WORD LINE.  A Japanese or Chinese chunk may carry `words`, its text
divided into words with a reading on each (lib/wordline.py says the grammar
and why).  It is the LAST argument of two macros of its own, \\chw and \\chrw
-- \\ch and \\chr with a word line -- because the arity is in the name, so
setting words on a \\ch rewrites that one call as a \\chw and blanking them
rewrites it back; nothing else in the file moves, and the proof says so.
The line is written verbatim and judged by wordline.check at the book's door,
never by the rules above: it is not set as literal text but cut into words by
lib/wordline.lua.  And it is judged against the WHOLE chunk after every edit,
because it is the text divided -- an fa changed under a word line that no
longer rejoins it is refused, not left for the PDF to stop on.  The chunk's
own reading is compared with it only to warn, and a book whose text is read
out of its written order says "reorders": true in book.json and is not.

THE CONTENTS.  \\parstart{chapter.paragraph}{incipit} carries the opening of
a paragraph, and it is what the PDF outline, the printed contents and the
reader's contents panel show.  The incipit is DERIVED from the text -- the fa
of the chunks of the paragraph's first subparagraph, six words, or twelve
characters for a language whose words are not separated -- and three tools
already derive it that way (assemble.py's incipit, inject_parstart.py's,
lib/draft.py's _incipit; lib/frank-preamble.tex says what it is for).  So an
edit to that text leaves it stale, and the contents would name a sentence no
longer in the book while the edit came back with fidelity "ok".  Rather than
report that and leave it, this file keeps the two in step -- derived data
following the text it is derived from -- and the byte-for-byte promise covers
TWO regions instead of one: the argument groups of the chunk, and the second
argument of one \\parstart.  Nothing else moves, and the proof before the
write says so.  A \\parstart that was not the derived incipit BEFORE the edit
either was written by hand: it is reported and left alone, the rule the
fidelity check already uses for a paragraph that did not reproduce its source
before the edit either.

FIDELITY.  verify_book.py proves every built paragraph against
source/paras/: its chunks, joined with the language's separator and stripped
of the language's marks, must reproduce the source paragraph exactly.
Changing fa can break that, and a chapter that has quietly stopped
reproducing its source is worse than a refused edit -- so an fa that would
break it is refused, in verify_book's own words.  A paragraph with no source
file, or one that did not reproduce its source before the edit either, cannot
be judged: the edit goes through and the result says which it was.

    `fields` holds any of col, fa, kana, tr, voc, en, words; only the keys
    present change.  col is '' or red/blue/orange/green and becomes the
    \\C<colour> macro or nothing.  `lang` overrides the book's own (a Lang or
    a code).

    Nothing else in the file moves.  The one thing outside the macro call
    that can is the second argument of the paragraph's \\parstart, which is
    the opening of this text and nothing but: when an fa in the paragraph's
    first subparagraph changes, the contents entry follows it (the docstring
    says why, and when it does not).  words set on a \\ch or \\chr, or blanked
    on a \\chw or \\chrw, change the macro's NAME with them, and then the one
    call is written again whole -- every other field as it was -- instead of
    group by group.

    Returns {path, index, macro, changed, fidelity, parstart, warnings,
    chunk} -- `macro` the name the chunk has now, `changed` the fields that
    actually differed (empty when the values were already there and the file
    was left alone), `fidelity` what verify_book.py would now say about the
    paragraph, `parstart` what became of the contents entry ("updated: ...",
    "not changed: ...", or "behind: ..." for an anchor written by hand, which
    is left as it is), `warnings` what wordline.check says of the chunk's
    words without refusing them, `chunk` the record read back off the new
    file.

    Raises Refused for an index the file does not have, a colour that is not
    one of the four, a field the macro has no slot for, a kana in a language
    with no reading, words in a language with no word layer, anything
    check_batch.py would reject in a field, a character that is not text, a
    word line that does not rejoin the chunk's text as it stands after the
    edit, an fa that would stop the paragraph reproducing its source, and
    emptying a field the language requires (en; tr where it romanises; kana
    where it has a reading) that holds something -- unless every box of the
    gloss is emptied with it, which deletes the gloss and leaves the chunk
    as one nobody has started (_check_required).  Filling the boxes one at
    a time is never refused: a chunk with part of its gloss written is saved
    as it is.  A \\chw or \\chrw whose gloss is emptied keeps its word line
    and its macro.  A word line edited on a chunk nobody has glossed yet
    takes its proposed reading with it: the reading lib/draft.py proposed
    from the old line is proposed again from the new one (and goes when the
    line is taken off), so the chunk stays blank -- unless the edit sends
    that reading too, which is then the person's.
