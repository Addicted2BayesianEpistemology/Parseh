"""The dictionary behind a chunk nobody has glossed.

A reading edition and a video are worth reading only when the glosses are
written, and writing them takes weeks.  Until they are, every chunk is a
phrase the reader cannot get past.  This looks the words up.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It is not a gloss and must never be shown as one.  A
gloss is a person's judgement about THIS word in THIS sentence: which of
eleven senses is meant, what the ending is doing, why the idiom is not the
sum of its parts.  A dictionary knows none of that.  So everything here is
returned marked -- with the source it came from and the route by which the
word was found -- and both readers draw it in their own chrome, apart from
the written glosses, with the source named on it.  The studio's glossary has
shown a guess as a red row since it had rows (markdown/app/htmlgen.py); this
is the same instinct one door along.

Nothing here ever writes to a book, a video or the Anki store.  An entry
becomes a gloss only when somebody editing a chunk takes it from the sources
sidebar beside the gloss editor into the vocabulary field, and saves; the
save goes down the ordinary edit route (lib/texwrite.py,
youtube/lib/annwrite.py) with the ordinary checkers on the far side.  What
the sidebar inserts is built from a hit's `headword` and `head_sound` -- the
LEMMA's own sound, never the sound of the form the chunk happened to hold.

WHERE THE DATA IS.  `dict/<code>.db`, one SQLite file per language, built by
lib/getdict.py and carried by nobody: they are tens of megabytes, they are
somebody else's work under somebody else's licence, and the toolbox has
always shipped the doors and none of the content.  A language with no file
has no lookup, and both readers simply do not offer it -- the same way a
book with no narration has no scrub bar.  sqlite3 is in the standard
library, so this costs nothing to install.

WHY SQLITE AND NOT A FILE OF LINES.  A Wiktionary extract for one language
is 30-100 MB and the server is stdlib Python on somebody's laptop, answering
a click while a video plays.  An index and a page cache beat reading a file.

THE ONLY HARD PART is that a dictionary is keyed by lemma and a chunk is
running text: `می‌کنم` is under `کردن`, `लड़कों` under `लड़का`,
`sāvatthiyaṃ` under `sāvatthī`.  `_routes` below is the cascade, and it is
allowed to fail: what it tried comes back with the answer, so a reader can
see that the word was looked for and not found rather than assume the
dictionary has nothing to say about the language.

def rules(code):

    Optional on purpose: a language with no file gets the surface form, the
    folded form and whatever the source's own form table knows, which for the
    European languages is nearly everything.  The file is where a language
    says the two things the data cannot:

        "fold":    "deva-iast" -- the dictionary is keyed in another script
                   than the page.  Where a source romanises its headwords
                   (Wiktionary does it for the classical Indic languages:
                   9129 Roman entries against 1473 in Devanagari, in the
                   extract this was measured on) and the edition prints
                   Devanagari, the word is transliterated before it is
                   looked for.  Deterministic, because that spelling is.
        "affixes": what to take off and what taking it off means.  These are
                   not new knowledge -- docs/lang/<code>.md already documents
                   every one of them for the annotator -- and the note is
                   shown to the reader, so a hit found by stripping `-hā` says
                   so rather than pretending the page said the lemma.
                   A rule is a `suffix` or a `prefix`, with the `note`; and
                   optionally `add`, put back at the end (a past stem given
                   its infinitive's ن); `front`, put back in front (Persian's
                   برمی‌گردم is `بر میگردم` in the table that lists it);
                   `after`, the endings the rest must have for the rule to
                   apply at all (an Italian enclitic comes off an infinitive's
                   -r or a gerund's -ndo, and never off the name Carla); and
                   `prefer`, notes that put an entry first when this rule is
                   the one that answered (after -mashita, the entry reached
                   through its `stem` row is the verb: 来ました is 来る).

    And, where the language needs them, what the source's rows mean that
    the rows cannot say themselves:

        "own":      notes that make a row the word itself, as an empty note
                    does: Chinese `Simplified-Chinese`, since 帮忙 IS 幫忙.
        "spelled":  notes saying the text spells the entry another way; the
                    hit then carries `spelled`, the text's spelling, so a
                    Simplified book is not handed a Traditional \\dw.
        "regional": sense tags that mark a sense as another lect's, and
                    those that bring it back (Cantonese, unless Mandarin).
        "bare_stem": notes of a stem that is not a word by itself: a hit
                    reached only through one, where the word is also some
                    entry's own headword, goes last (در is `in`, not
                    دریدن's present stem).
        "also_peel": the entries a whole word may match that are only
                    spellings of two words (`pos`, or a note containing one
                    of `note_has`): French n'avait is a page, and a pointer
                    at ne; the affixes are then tried as well, so avoir is
                    reached too.
        "join_next": the words a text may write apart from the word they
                    belong to (`words`, compared without marks), and what
                    the two must be together to count (`pos`): Persian's
                    نمی and می before a verb, written with a plain space
                    where the joiner belongs (`نِمی سوزانَند`).  Such a word
                    is looked up JOINED to the next one, as one word; the
                    reader is shown both as written, and the next word is
                    looked up on its own only when the two together find

    usually lands (می‌سازم is listed as a form of ساختن), so what needs two is
    exactly the interesting case: a form Wiktionary does not list, carrying
    an ending it does.

    The affixes are applied to the FOLDED spellings and not only to the raw
    word, because an affix rule is written in the script the DICTIONARY is
    keyed in, not the one the page is printed in.  Where a dictionary is
    romanised and the pages are Devanagari the endings are Roman (`-ssa`,
    `-aṃ`) while the word is not, so applying them to the surface form
    matched nothing at all: `बुद्धं` tried itself, then `buddhaṃ`, and
    stopped one step short of `buddha`.

    Nothing is visited twice, so a rule taking a form back where it came from
    cannot loop, and the total is capped -- a rule set written badly should
    cost a slow answer, not a hung server.

    A page that IS the headword sorts above a page that merely mentions it,
    and the note on a form row ("genitive singular") comes back with it so a
    reader is told what the ending was doing.

    ONE ROW PER ENTRY.  A word reaches its lemma by several paths at once --
    `me` is the accusative, instrumental, dative AND ablative of `ahaṃ`, and
    each is a form row -- and printing the same entry four times with four
    labels is a wall of repetition around one meaning.  The paths are
    gathered into the one note instead, which is also the more useful
    answer: *accusative, instrumental, dative or ablative singular* is what
    the reader actually faces.

    THE ENTRIES ARE CHOSEN FIRST AND THEIR ROWS READ AFTER.  The cap used to
    be on rows -- 32 of them, then the first four entries among those -- and
    that was safe only while an entry had one row per spelling.  It has
    several now (lib/getdict.py keeps `walked` as the past AND the past
    participle, German `fahren` as infinitive, first and third plural, and
    more), so one busy entry could eat the budget and push a second lemma
    off the answer.  Four entries, then every row of each for this form, in
    the source's order -- which is also the order the notes are read out in.

    Each hit names its `entry` -- the id, which is how anything after this
    reads that entry's table, and the only thing that tells homographs apart
    (Persian has two رفتن: raftan to go, roftan to sweep) -- and its
    `head_sound`: how the LEMMA is said.  `translit` is how the word IN THE
    CHUNK is said, and the two differ exactly when it matters: می‌سازم has
    translit mi-sāzam and head_sound sāxtan, and the sidebar that paired the
    headword with the first wrote `\\dw{ساختن}{mi-sāzam}`.

    A LETTER OF THE ALPHABET GOES LAST, in a language written with spaces.
    Spanish `y` is the conjunction and also the letter's own page (pos
    `character`), which Wiktionary lists first; so is `a`, and Italian `i`,
    `e` and `o`.  A word in running text is almost never the name of a
    letter.  In Chinese and Japanese `character` is the entry for the
    written word itself -- 吃 is pos character -- and nothing moves.

    THE REST OF THE ORDER IS _tier_of's, and every rung of it was a verb
    lost off the end of four: a name reached through its lower case after
    the words (given/Given, not give), a compound reached through one of its
    words after every single word (هستند/بلد بودن, not بودن), a bare stem
    that is another word's headword last (در/دریدن), an entry reached only as
    an auxiliary not at all (haben/raven).  `prefer` is the answering rule's
    (lib/lang/<code>.lookup.json): the rows that put an entry first when
    that rule found the form -- 来 after -mashita is 来る's `stem`.  Where
    the word is four entries and none a verb, the verb it is a form of takes
    the fourth place (`left`: leave).  A hit carries `spelled`, the text's
    spelling, where the language says the row it came through is another
    spelling of the entry (帮忙 for 幫忙).
