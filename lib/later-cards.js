/* Parseh — REVIEW LATER: the cards made from the list, one by one and one
   after another (a0.5.0).

   The list of a book or a video (lib/later.js) has two doors to the page's
   own card sheet: «+ card» on a row, and «Make cards one after another» over
   the list.  What opens the sheet, and how the page knows that a card was
   SAVED, is each page's own (the reader's layer, lib/later-reader.js; the
   player, youtube/lib/player.js) -- the sheet is theirs, with its three
   targets and its cut editor.  What the two have in common is here: ask the
   page to open its sheet for a flag, wait for how it ended, and for the
   queue, a strip over the sheet that says which item it is and lets the
   person Skip or Stop.

   THE PAGE HANDS OVER ONE FUNCTION, open(flag), which answers (a promise of)
   a SESSION, or null when the chunk is not there any more:

       { box:   the card sheet's own element, which the strip is put into
         done:  a promise of how the sheet ended -- 'saved' once a card was
                saved on ANY of its three targets (Anki, an exercise deck, the
                markdown on the clipboard), 'closed' when it was shut without
                one (Esc, ✕, the backdrop)
         close: shut the sheet, saved or not }

   HOW IT ENDS, in the queue: a saved card takes its flag off the list (with
   no «removed · Undo» line, which would say it again and again) and the next
   sheet opens a moment later, so that the sheet's own answer can be read;
   Skip leaves the flag where it is and opens the next; Stop, and the sheet
   shut by hand, end the queue -- the way out of a sheet is Esc, and it must
   not need pressing once more for every item left.

   The sheet's remembered target, deck and type stay as the page keeps them:
   nothing here touches them.  No HTML is made from a string in this file. */
