"""Cut a sentence into the phrases a reader should meet it in.

    chunker.chunk(text, "fa")                 -> one chunk per sentence
    chunker.chunk(text, "fa", "phrase")       -> sense groups
    chunker.WAYS                              -> what may be asked for

WHAT A CHUNK IS FOR.  In Frank's method the reader meets a piece of the
foreign text and then its gloss, and the chunk is the unit of that mapping.
That fixes what a good one is from both sides at once: it has to be small
enough to hold in the head while the eye moves to the gloss, and whole
enough that the gloss is a natural translation OF EXACTLY THAT SPAN.  A cut
through the middle of a phrase fails the second test -- half a prepositional
phrase has no honest gloss -- and a whole sentence fails the first, because
the reader stops mapping and starts reading the translation.

So the rule is: CUT AT THE EDGES OF PHRASES, NEVER INSIDE ONE, and aim for
two to five words.  Everything below is that rule made mechanical.

WHAT HOLDS A PHRASE TOGETHER, in the order the rules are worth:

  1  A FUNCTION WORD IS NEVER ALONE.  An adposition goes with its object
     (`in the house`, `به خانه`, `家に`), a particle or case marker with the
     word before it, an article or determiner with its noun, a Persian ezafe
     with what it governs.  Alone, none of them can be glossed at all.  This
     is the highest-frequency rule there is and the cheapest to get right.
  2  A FIXED EXPRESSION IS ONE CHUNK even where that breaks the syntax.  A
     light-verb compound (`فکر کردن`, `勉強する`), an idiom, a phrasal verb:
     the meaning is not in the pieces, and showing the pieces teaches a
     reader something untrue.  This one needs the dictionary, and where the
     dictionary is silent it is the model's job -- the prompts say so.
  3  THE VERB GROUP IS THE UNIT, NOT THE VERB.  Auxiliaries, negation, a
     separable prefix, the light verb of a compound: a tense is one thing.
     `نمی‌روم` is one word; `می‌خواهم بروم` and `食べている` are one verb each
     in two pieces, and cutting between them leaves two halves that mean
     nothing on their own.
  4  A NOUN KEEPS ITS MODIFIERS.  Adjectives, numerals, demonstratives,
     possessives -- on whichever side the language puts them.
  5  A CLAUSE BOUNDARY IS ALWAYS A CHUNK BOUNDARY, and a conjunction or
     relativiser opens the chunk it introduces rather than closing the one
     before it.
  6  AN ADVERB JOINS THE VERB IT MODIFIES when it stands next to it, and
     otherwise stands on its own: a manner adverb belongs to the verb group,
     a sentence adverb (`yesterday`, `فردا`) modifies the whole clause and
     glosses perfectly well alone.

AND WHAT A CHUNK MUST NOT BE.  Not one word per word -- that is a dictionary
with the text interleaved, and the reader never learns how the language
phrases anything.  Not a whole clause.  A one-word chunk is right only when
the word IS the utterance (`Yes`, `Stop`, `بله`) or when nothing may attach
to it.

HOW MUCH OF THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT A PARSER.  None is required: this
toolbox is stdlib Python.  What there is instead, asked in this order:

  * PUNCTUATION, in every language and with nothing installed.  A comma, a
    semicolon, a colon, a 、 or a ， ends a clause, and rule 5 makes that a
    chunk boundary.  It is the one cue every writer prints, and a cut blind
    to it lands inside the next phrase instead: `寒い朝に、窓を | 開ける。`,
    `When I got | home, my mother`.
  * THE LANGUAGE'S OWN FUNCTION WORDS, listed in lib/lang/<code>.chunk.json:
    its articles, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and auxiliaries, a
    closed list of a few hundred words that a dictionary is the wrong
    authority on -- Wiktionary files `man` under an interjection and `not`
    under a conjunction, and whichever reading it listed first used to decide
    the cut.  A word under two headings is read in its place: `that man`,
    `that he`, `that is`; `la casa`, `la vedo`.
  * THE DICTIONARY the reading panel already uses, for everything else: a
    part of speech for every word it holds, weighted by how many senses it
    gives each reading, and an inflected form reached through the language's
    own affix rules.  Parts of speech plus adjacency get rules 1, 3, 4, 5 and
    6 right most of the time; rule 2 needs more than a word list and is left
    to the model, which is why the offline cut is offered as a CHOICE and
    never imposed.  A spaced language with neither a list nor a dictionary is
    cut at its punctuation and nowhere else, rather than at random.
  * FOR A LANGUAGE WRITTEN WITHOUT SPACES, the words lib/words.py divides it
    into where its analyzer is installed -- SudachiPy for Japanese, pkuseg
    with its part-of-speech model for Chinese: the words the word strip shows
    -- with the part of speech it names for each piece, so that a chunk never
    ends inside a word and a particle, a modifier, a coverb and a verb's
    auxiliaries are known for what they are.  Without it the characters are
    read against the language's own lists (lib/lang/<code>.chunk.json):
    Japanese's particles and marks, Chinese's punctuation.

THE INVARIANT.  Chunks are slices of the source, joined by the language's
own separator, and `chunk()` is checked against the text it was given: the
whole toolbox rests on a chunk sequence reproducing what it came from, so a
chunker that cannot promise that returns one chunk and says nothing clever.
