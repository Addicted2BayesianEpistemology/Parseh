"""Where a book lives and what it is called.

One directory per book under books/<language folder>/, each with a book.json:

    books/persian/farsi-shakar-ast/     books/japanese/<slug>/

Adding a title means adding a directory -- no tool has a list of books in it,
and none has a path to a particular book baked in.  The language folder is
the registry's `folder` (lib/languages.json says which folders there
are); the book's own language is book.json's "language" (a registry
code, default fa), and the two are expected to agree -- the JSON wins for
rendering, the folder for the URL, and a mismatch is reported once.

book.json declares a second language, "gloss": what the glosses are WRITTEN
in, which is not the same question as what the book teaches (an Italian
learning English wants the meanings in Italian).  Absent it is English, so
every book written before the field existed says what it always said.

    from books import find_book, all_books
    b = find_book("books/persian/<slug>")     # or a slug, or the current directory
    b.main            .../books/persian/<slug>/main.tex
    b.lang            the Lang record (b.lang.code, .dir, .strip(), .digits ...)
    b.gloss_lang      the Gloss record: what the glosses are written in
    b.has_audio       False when book.json has no audio, or the file is absent

A book.json found directly under books/ (the layout before languages) is
still read, as Persian, with a note to move it.
