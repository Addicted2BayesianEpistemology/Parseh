/* Parseh — the service worker of the mobile interface (docs/mobile.md, §19).
   Served by serve.py at /sw.js, so that its scope is the whole toolbox;
   registered by lib/parseh.js and by the studio's pages while the mode is
   mobile.

   IT USED TO KEEP NOTHING.  Parseh is a server on somebody's own computer,
   and every page came from there, fresh; the worker existed because a browser
   installs only a site that has one, and answered a page of its own when the
   computer could not be reached.  §19 reverses that: what has been KEPT ON
   THIS PHONE is answered from the phone, so a book, a video, a document or a
   deck works with the computer asleep, off or a train away.

   WHAT IS KEPT, AND WHERE.  One cache per thing -- `parseh-kept-<id>` -- so
   that removing a book is deleting one cache, and two books share nothing but
   the shared files (`parseh-shared`), which are kept once for all of them.
   The page decides what goes in: it asks the computer what a thing is made of
   (`<thing>/__offline`, lib/offline.py) and sends the list here (lib/keep.js).

   AND A BOOK MAY ARRIVE BY THE BROWSER'S OWN DOWNLOAD (the owner's decision
   of 2026-09-23).  Where the page's registration has Background Fetch -- on
   Android -- lib/keep.js hands a book to it rather than to `keep` here, since
   a browser stops this worker's event after five minutes and a narration
   does not arrive inside that; this file then only PUTS IT AWAY when the
   browser wakes it (`settle`, near the end of the keeping half).  The iPad
   and Firefox keep by `keep`, exactly as before.

   WHICH COPY ANSWERS: THE KEPT ONE (the owner's choice, 2026-09-22).  A page
   opens at once, with no wait for a computer that may be asleep, and what is
   newer is found behind it -- the small parts of a kept thing are fetched
   again in the background and put back in the cache, so the next open has
   them.  Anything not kept goes to the network exactly as it did, and a
   NAVIGATION that fails is answered with the offline page.

   THE APP MUST OPEN AT ALL (the owner's 1 and 2, 2026-09-23; TO-DO §0).  It
   did not: it stalled on its own splash, for two reasons that had to be put
   right together.

     - THE DEADLINE.  `fetch` waits for a socket, not for a computer.  With a
       network present but the computer unreachable -- asleep, or a Tailscale
       peer that is down -- the socket never settles, respondWith never
       resolves, and the splash stays for ever.  Every navigation now has
       about two and a half seconds (DEADLINE), so a hanging socket falls
       exactly where a refused one falls.  A door with no kept copy behind
       it waits a great deal longer (PATIENT), because nothing could take its
       place and some doors are honestly slow; but it waits, and does not
       hang.  (Whether the computer is there at all is not asked through
       here: see the end of this file.)
     - THE APP SHELL.  The app's start address is `/?mode=mobile` and it was
       in no cache, so there was nothing for the deadline to fall back to.
       The way in is kept now -- the hub, the shelves, the two libraries and
       Kept on this phone, with their sheets and their scripts -- from one
       list the computer gives at `/__shell` (lib/offline.py, shell()).

   AND THE APP MUST INSTALL AT ALL (the owner, from his phone, later the same
   day).  It stopped installing: Chrome offered, he accepted, and no icon
   appeared.  This worker is why.  Keeping the way in had been written into
   the INSTALL event, and that event grew until it fetched fifty-nine
   addresses weighing three and a quarter megabytes, one after another, with
   nothing but the installation waiting on it -- so over a tunnel the worker
   stayed in `installing` for minutes, and a site whose worker has not
   activated is a site the browser will not install.  Chromium's own guidance
   is that the install event caches the bare minimum and that anything large
   or optional is fetched afterwards.

   SO THE WORKER WARMS ITSELF, AND IS ASKED TO.  `install` caches the app's
   own two pages, as it did before any of §19, and activates at once; neither
   it nor `activate` waits on the shell.  The way in and the studio's faces
   are fetched by `warm` instead, which a PAGE asks for by message once it is
   open and drawn (lib/keep.js, and the install page) -- one address at a
   time, passing over whatever this phone already holds, and saying as it
   goes how far it has got, so that the owner reads "Getting ready — 41 of
   59" rather than watching a silence that looks like nothing happening (his
   decision, 2026-09-23).  A warm may be cut off at any moment, because the
   browser stops a worker whenever it likes; that costs nothing, because the
   caches are the whole of the state and the next ask carries on from what is
   in them.

   A SHELL PAGE IS NOT THE "CANNOT BE REACHED" PAGE.  It opens as it always
   does, wearing the offline chip; `/m/offline/` is left for a navigation that
   is neither kept nor in the shell.  And it must not show yesterday's shelf
   in silence: a shell page is answered from the phone AND read again behind
   the page, and when the computer's answer differs the clients are told
   (`shellFresh`), so lib/keep.js puts the fresh list in place of the one the
   page opened with.  The two lists a library page asks for rather than
   carries -- the decks and the documents -- go the other way round: the
   computer first, under the same deadline, and the phone's last copy behind
   it.

   SEEKING IN A KEPT RECORDING.  A recording is played by `Range` requests and
   the Cache API knows nothing of ranges: a kept narration would play from
   0:00 and refuse to be moved.  So a range asked of a kept file is cut here,
   out of the whole response, and answered 206 with the headers a media
   element needs.  That is what makes ↺ and ↻ work on a train.

   WHAT HAS NO ANSWER OFFLINE says so at once rather than hanging: looking a
   word up, the translation, an UNKEPT note and every door that writes
   (§19.6 -- the owner chose to keep no dictionary and no
   translation model on the phone).  They are answered 503 with a line of
   JSON saying it needs the computer.

   A NOTE, THOUGH, CAN NOW BE KEPT (the owner's second block of 2026-09-23).
   A kept book carries its notes' bare pages, their pictures and the seams'
   list that is how the reader finds them; a kept copy is looked at before
   any of the refusals below, so what is kept is answered and only what is
   not is refused.  Two things follow from it here:

     - THE SEAMS' LIST IS A DOOR, not a file.  `<mount>/api/marks` is what
       says which notes exist and where they sit, and it is asked of the
       computer first under the ordinary deadline with the kept copy behind
       it (`isDoor`), so a note written at the desk this morning shows its
       mark the moment the phone can reach the computer -- and the same list
       still opens the book on a train.
     - THE STUDIO'S OWN FILES ARE SHARED.  A note opens on the studio's
       sheet and in its own faces, and those are kept once for the phone
       rather than once per book: see `isShared`.  And ONCE means once: what
       any cache of this origin holds already -- the app shell keeps the same
       faces -- is not sent for a second time (`keep`), and when the last
       kept thing goes, what the shell does not itself need is given back
       (`reclaim`).  */
'use strict';
/* WHICH PARSEH THIS WORKER CAME WITH (TO-DO §13.16, the app's half of an
   update).  A browser installs a new worker only when the bytes of /sw.js
   change, and a release that did not happen to edit this file changed none
   of them: the phone went on running the old worker, holding the old way in,
   and nothing anywhere told the person that the Parseh on his computer was
   another one.  So the server writes this Parseh's version and build into
   the two strings below AS IT SERVES THE FILE (lib/mobile.py, worker()):
   every release is different bytes, so every release is a new worker on
   every phone the next time it reaches the computer, and that worker is what
   says, in one line on the page, that Parseh was updated.

   THE BUILD IS THE RELEASE'S COMMIT, where the install has a release
   manifest to read it from, and nothing where it has none.  It is there for
   the one case the version cannot tell apart: the same version installed
   twice, which is how a build nobody has seen yet is iterated on -- fixed,
   rebuilt under the same number, installed again -- and each of those is a
   new worker too.

   READ OFF THE DISK UNSTAMPED -- by a test, or by any server that does not
   know to write it -- the worker knows no release at all, and says nothing

// nothing.
//
// PATIENT is the one for an ask with NOTHING behind it, and it exists because
// having no fallback is not a reason to wait FOR EVER.  `fetch` waits for a
// socket and not for a computer: towards a computer that is asleep on a
// network that is up, the socket settles neither way, and a page waiting on
// a door with nothing behind it would wait with it.  It is generous rather
// than short because the failure at this end is the opposite one: some doors
// are honestly slow (a waveform drawn off a film, a deck read after an

/* ---- is what was kept still whole? -------------------------------------
   A TICK USED TO MEAN "THIS ADDRESS IS A KEY IN THIS CACHE" and nothing more
   (the owner's 3, 2026-09-23).  It did not mean the body was all there, or
   that it was the file at all: a 503 refusal kept by mistake, a page the
   computer sent where a picture was asked for, a fetch cut off halfway by a
   tunnel -- every one of them leaves a key in the cache and every one of them
   ticked a box.  That is the fault this answers: the sheet now ticks from
   here and from nothing else, and what cannot be shown to be whole is
   unticked, so Save fetches it again.

   WHAT "WHOLE" MEANS, and it is decided by what the record can promise:

     - a refusal or a failure that was kept is never whole (`res.ok`);
     - an HTML page where a file was expected is never whole: the computer
       answering a page -- a login, a "not found", a shell -- where a
       recording or a picture was asked for is the commonest lie a cache can
       be told, and the content type shows it at no cost at all;
     - where the record gives a DIGEST, the body must hash to it.  That is
       the whole truth about the file, and the computer gives one for every
       file it can afford to hash (lib/offline.py, DIGEST_MAX);
     - where it does not -- a narration of two hundred megabytes, which
       WebCrypto cannot hash without holding all of it in memory at once --
       the LENGTH must match.  The header says it, so nothing is read at all.

   AND WHERE THE RECORD'S SIZE IS AN ESTIMATE, THE LENGTH IS NOT A PROMISE.
   A note's page and an exercise's are RENDERED by the computer, and what
   lib/offline.py weighs for them is the source on the disk plus the wrapper
   -- an honest guess at what they will cost and never the answer's own byte
   count.  The record says so itself (`check: "here"`, lib/offline.py's
   _door): the phone may test that it HAS that answer and must test nothing
   else about it.  Where an older computer's record says nothing, the address
   is read instead -- one that names no file (it ends in a slash, or in
   nothing) is composed -- because measuring a rendered page against a guess
   would untick everything the sheet has, which is a worse lie than the one
   being mended.                                                            */

/* WHICH CACHES ARE LOOKED IN, AND IT IS THE VERY QUESTION `keep` ASKS.  The
   two have to agree, because between them they are one promise made twice:
   this says a box may be ticked, and that decides whether Save fetches the
   file behind it.  They did not agree.  This looked in the SHELL and in the
   app's own two pages as well, so a studio face that only the shell held was
   called whole and ticked -- while `keep` refuses to lean on the shell
   deliberately (the shell is the APP's copy, dropped whole whenever SHELL's
   version is bumped), so Save never fetched one of this thing's own, and the
   thing went on borrowing the app's until the next release took it away and
   left its notes drawing in whatever face the phone had.  A tick that says
   "there is no need to fetch this" must rest on a cache that will outlive
   the thing it was ticked for: this thing's own, and the shared one, which
   is freed only when nothing at all is kept (`reclaim`).  NOT another kept
   thing's cache either -- a face that answers today because somebody else's
   book holds it goes when that book does.

   The thing's own cache is opened only when it EXISTS.  `caches.open` makes
   one where there is none, and an empty `parseh-kept-…` left lying about is
   not nothing: `reclaim` reads "any kept cache at all" as "something is still
   kept here", and would then never give the shared four megabytes back.

   AND AN UPDATE IS NOT DAMAGE (TO-DO §13.16, the owner: the keep check must
   not cry wolf).  The digest the page hands this is the computer's NOW, and
   a new release of Parseh changes its own scripts by design -- so every kept
   copy of /lib/'s files failed its digest the morning after an update, and
   the sheet called a phone full of perfectly good books "no longer whole".
   What tells the two apart is the digest each file was KEPT with, which is
   written on the kept copy itself (`stamped`, by `keep`, `settle` and
   `renew`).  A body is then one of three things:

     - it hashes to the computer's digest: WHOLE.  Where the digest it was
       kept with is another -- `renew` brought the new release's copy and
       could not write it down, or the copy predates the writing down --
       the record is REFRESHED to the digest it really has, and nothing is
       fetched: the file is `updated`, and the next release is measured
       against the file that is here, not against the one that was;
     - it hashes to the digest it was kept with, and the computer's has
       moved on since: still WHOLE -- nothing in it was lost -- and
       `updated`, and NOT fetched again (kept things can be big, the owner's
       words).  A page that uses it brings the new copy behind itself, as
       every kept page's small parts are (`renew`);
     - it hashes to neither: NO LONGER WHOLE, exactly as before.  A copy with
       no digest written on it is measured against the computer's alone, as
       every copy was before this. */

   (2.1 MB) are what a note opens on, and a shelf of ten books that each kept
   its own copy would be forty megabytes of the same four.

   Two prefixes say it.  `/lib/` is the toolbox's own, as it always was.  The

   its own mount (markdown/app/server.py, serve_static and the maths routes),

   than at the book's notes mount for exactly this reason -- so two books'

   names the studio's sheets and scripts IN FULL, and its thirteen faces in
   `later` (lib/offline.py, shell(): studio_files and studio_faces, every one
   of them under `<studio>/static/`).  So the prefix is read off those
   addresses: everything up to and including the `/static/` they all share.
   Both lists are looked at, because which of the two carries the studio's
   files is lib/offline.py's business and not this file's.

   WITH NO SHELL LIST YET there is no answer -- and none is WRITTEN DOWN

   empty answer remembered, every studio file would go into kept things' own
   caches for the rest of that worker's life, long after the list had come.
   So it is worked out afresh until there is something to work it out from.

   Until then the studio's files go into the kept thing's own cache.  That
   costs the room twice on a second book rather than telling a lie: they are
   still kept, still answered, and still freed when the thing that paid for
   them is removed.  And the empty answer stays EMPTY rather than becoming a
   prefix that matches everything -- `isShared` tests it before it compares,

/* WHAT THIS PHONE ALREADY HOLDS IS NOT FETCHED AGAIN (the owner's 4: ONCE).
   The studio's thirteen faces are 1.83 MB and a warmed app shell holds them
   too, so a first keep of a book with notes used to send for the very bytes
   that were already lying on the disk, and then hold them twice.  "A warmed
   one": since the faces left the way in, the shell has them once `warm` has
   been asked for them, and before that this phone simply has not got them
   and the fetch below is the honest answer.

   "ALREADY HERE" IS ASKED OF THE CACHES, NOT GUESSED FROM THE ADDRESS, and
   that is the whole of why this works.  A cache is the only thing that knows
   what is on the disk, and it is the same question `answer` will ask when a
   page comes for the file later -- `caches.match` looks in all of them, so a
   face sitting in the shell's cache answers a note's page as perfectly as a
   copy in the shared one would.  Deciding from the address instead would
   mean writing down here which list holds what, and the two lists would be
   wrong about each other the first time either moved.

   WHICH CACHES MAY BE LEANT ON (`held`), and the rule is the same one every
   time: lean only on a cache that will outlive the thing being kept.  For a
   KEEP those are the shared cache -- freed only when nothing at all is kept

/* ---- a book kept in the background: Android's own download --------------
   THE OWNER'S DECISION OF 2026-09-23.  A narrated book is hundreds of
   megabytes, often in ONE recording, and `keep` above could not bring it:
   it runs inside one message event, and Chromium stops a worker whose event
   has run five minutes (driven: stopped at 310 s, the fetch in flight cut,
   no `catch` run, no `{kept}` sent).  So where the page's registration has
   Background Fetch, a BOOK is handed to the browser's own download machinery
   instead, which goes on with the page closed, the browser closed and the
   phone locked, and shows Android's own notification with its own Cancel.
   Everywhere else -- the iPad, Firefox -- `keep` above does it exactly as it
   always did: that is not a lesser way, it is the whole feature there.

   THE PAGE STARTS IT, NOT THIS FILE.  Since Chrome 149 a worker may not
   start a background fetch at all (driven: NotAllowedError, "not allowed in
   service worker environments", although `'backgroundFetch' in
   self.registration` is still true here).  lib/keep.js decides, per press,
   on the page's own registration, and starts two downloads: the text first
   (with the notes, which travel with it), then the recordings -- so a book
   opens on a train as soon as its text is in.  It leaves a NOTE for this
   file (`JOBS`), since the download may end with every page closed and a
   worker the browser has only just woken: what the thing is, which of its
   addresses each download holds, what each should weigh, and the registry
   entry to write once it is done.

   THE DOWNLOAD ENDING IS NOT THE KEEP ENDING (the owner's brief).  The
   browser wakes this worker with backgroundfetchsuccess / fail / abort, and
   `settle` then does what `keep` does address by address: looks at each
   answer, puts what is whole where `isShared` says, and says `{kept}` in the
   same words -- to every page, since this event has no page to answer.  A
   success is not taken on trust: a connection refused under the download
   can end in "success" over an EMPTY body with status 200 and the file's own
   Content-Length (driven, four ways), so every answer is measured
   (`arrived`) before it is put away, and a phone that runs out of room while
   putting it away is a keep that did not happen, whatever the download said.

   WHAT A KEEP ENDING PART-WAY LEAVES (the owner): what arrived.  A Cancel on
   either notification stops the whole keep; a file the computer no longer
   has, and no room on the phone, are each said in their own words.  Remove
   (lib/keep.js, /m/kept/) marks the note `removed` first, and then nothing
   of that download is put away at all. */

// answered while the first was there, never renewed -- and it is the copy the

// drops the way in.  So each cache that holds the address gets it, the app's
