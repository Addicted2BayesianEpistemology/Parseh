"""Updating Parseh in place, from Settings (TO-DO §13.16): to a newer
version, back to an older one, or the same one again.

    import updater                      the server's half: the page, the plan, the start
    updater.installed(root)             which release this is, or why it cannot be updated
    updater.latest()                    GitHub's newest release, asked once
    updater.fetch(root, info, ...)      its zip downloaded, checked, made the candidate
    updater.take(root, path, ...)       a zip the person chose, checked, made the candidate
    updater.plan(root)                  what installing the candidate would do, in full
    updater.begin(root, ...)            the job written down; the helper does the rest

    python3 .parseh-update/helper.py run ROOT       the helper: stop, replace, start again
    python3 .parseh-update/helper.py resume ROOT    an update that did not finish, finished or undone
    python3 .parseh-update/helper.py rollback ROOT  the last update undone from its backup

The last three are run by Parseh itself -- by the server, by lib/launcher.py
and by the first lines of serve.py -- and never by a person: everything a
person does is a button on Settings > Updating Parseh (lib/updatepage.py).

WHY IT IS NOT "UNZIP OVER THE TOP".  A person's work lives inside the
install: books/, youtube/videos/, markdown/library/, exercises/,
youtube/anki/, clips/, dict/, corpus/, mt/, components/, config/, .tls/,
.runtime/.  A release zip is, by definition, the exact list of what belongs
to Parseh at one version -- everything else in the folder is the person's.
So an update is: write the new version's files, AND DELETE THE PATHS THE OLD
VERSION SHIPPED THAT THE NEW ONE DOES NOT (the half everybody forgets, and
without which a retired file lives for ever), and touch nothing that is in
neither list.  Both lists are the releases' manifests, .parseh-release.json
(lib/release.py writes one into every zip, and the zip puts it at the root
of every install): the one in the install says what is there, the one in the
zip what is wanted.

ANY DIRECTION, BECAUSE THE MANIFESTS MAKE THEM ONE ALGORITHM.  Nothing here
asks "is it newer?".  Going BACK is how a release that went wrong is
escaped, and installing THE SAME VERSION AGAIN is how a build nobody has
seen yet is iterated on -- find a fault, fix it, build the same number,
install it again.  So the direction is only ever SAID: plan() names it, the
page words the button after it ("Update to", "Go back to", "Install ...
again"), and a step back is never presented as an ordinary update.

WHAT MAKES A STEP BACK DANGEROUS IS DATA, NOT FILES.  Old code can meet what
newer code wrote -- a deck's schedule, a video's annotations, the settings.
Each shape Parseh writes has a number of its own (lib/version.py FORMATS),
every manifest carries them, and a move that would take any of them DOWN is
refused unless the person insists, having been told in words what may not
survive.  When they insist, a copy of the content's small files -- the
json, the databases, the .tex, not the narrations and the films -- is taken
before anything is written, so that going forward again finds them.

A FILE OF PARSEH'S THAT WAS CHANGED BY HAND is overwritten, its old copy is
kept in the backup, and it is LISTED in the report -- never a question per
file (the owner, 2026-09-24): the installer compiles the guide into
html-guide/site/, which the release ships too, so asking would interrogate
somebody about dozens of files.  A file the new version ships that was
there already and was NOT Parseh's -- a language's lib/lang/<code>.tex
somebody added by hand, before Parseh shipped one of the same name -- is
treated the same way, and listed apart.

AND SUCH A FILE IS GIVEN BACK (the owner, 2026-09-25).  Its backup is the
only copy of something that was never Parseh's, so the day an update
installs a version that no longer ships that name -- going back, most
often, but any version will do -- the person's own file goes back where it
was, from the backup of the update that took it, and the report lists it as
put back.  Which update took which file is read from the jobs kept, newest
first (a report's "foreign" list, and what later reports settled); a job
removed with its backup (only the last KEEP_JOBS are kept) leaves its
unsettled paths in taken.json, so that the day the name is retired the
report can still say plainly that the person's copy is gone, rather than
say nothing.  A version that ships a folder where the file was cannot take
it back: it stays in its backup, and the report says where.

WHY A HELPER PROCESS.  The server runs from the very files an update
replaces, and Windows will not let a running program's files go.  So the
server writes the job down (begin) and stops; a helper -- a copy of THIS
FILE, taken into .parseh-update/helper.py, so that nothing it runs is
replaced under it -- applies it and starts the server again.  Who starts the
helper depends on who started the server:

  * lib/launcher.py (serve.bat on Windows) keeps the server in its own
    console window and waits on it.  The server leaves with LAUNCHER_EXIT,
    the launcher runs the helper in that window, then starts the server
    again there: the window the person knows stays the log.
  * anything else (serve.sh, Parseh.command, `python3 serve.py`): the server
    starts the helper as a process of its own, in a session of its own, so
    that the server's end does not take it along; the helper starts the new
    server exactly as the old one was started -- the same Python, the same
    arguments -- in the background, its log in serve.log and its pid where
    serve.sh looks.

WHILE THE SERVER IS DOWN, the helper answers on the server's own port from
this computer alone: /settings/api/update/state says how far it has got,
and any other address a page that says "Parseh is being updated" and comes
back by itself.  So the page that started the update shows every step, and
a tab left open elsewhere is not met by a refused connection.

A HALF-FINISHED UPDATE IS FINISHED OR UNDONE, NEVER LEFT.  The order is:
wait for the server to be gone; copy the content's small files (only for a
step back that lowers a data format); add to the environment what the new
version asks (only when it asks); back up every file of Parseh's that is
about to be overwritten or deleted; delete, then write, each write a
whole-file rename; write the new manifest; the post-steps; start again.
Every step is recorded as it finishes in the job's journal, and a file the
update CREATES is recorded before it is created -- which is all undoing
needs, since everything else it changed is in the backup.  If the helper is
killed (a power cut, a closed laptop, somebody's kill -9), the next start of
Parseh -- serve.py and lib/launcher.py ask finish_first() before they import
anything else of Parseh's -- runs the helper copy again: it carries the
update on where the release's zip is still whole, and undoes it from the
backup where it is not.  A new version that does not start is undone too,
and the old one started again.

THE ENVIRONMENT IS TOUCHED ONLY WHEN THE NEW VERSION ASKS (§13.3): each
manifest records what environment.yml required, and when the two differ the
packages the target asks for and this environment may lack are installed
BEFORE a file of Parseh's is replaced -- so a step that fails leaves the old
version exactly as it was.  A step back KEEPS the newer environment and says
so (an older Parseh runs with newer packages; going forward again then
needs nothing), and only adds what the older version needs and the
environment lacks.  A change of Python cannot be made inside the
environment Parseh runs in, and is refused in words rather than attempted.

WHERE THINGS ARE KEPT, all under .parseh-update/ at the root of the install
and in no manifest (an update never touches it, nor does the release
builder ship it):

    incoming/                 the candidate: the zip, and what it is
    jobs/<id>/                one update: its job, its journal, the zip it
                              installs, backup/ (Parseh's files as they
                              were), content/ (the small files, for a step
                              back), report.json, log.txt
    helper.py                 the helper, a copy of this file
    pending.json              there while an update is not finished
    state.json                how far the current or last update got
    taken.json                files of the person's that an update took,
                              whose backup has gone with that update

The last KEEP_JOBS jobs are kept; older ones are removed when an update
finishes.  config/updates.json keeps the one setting the updater has -- a
daily look at GitHub, off until ticked -- and what the last look found.

IT SENDS NOTHING ABOUT THE PERSON.  The look at GitHub is one question --
which release is newest -- asked with Parseh's name and version as its user
agent, from the address the computer already has.

STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY AT THE TOP, because the helper is this file run on its
own from .parseh-update/, beside an install that may be half replaced.  The
server's half imports lib/version.py, lib/release.py and lib/download.py
inside the functions that need them; the helper imports none of them, and
reaches lib/runtime.py only for the environment step, which runs before any
file is replaced.

A TEST HOOK, AND ONLY ONE: PARSEH_UPDATE_TEST_DELAY, seconds to wait after
each file written, makes the window in which a test kills the helper half
way (tests/test_updater.py).  Unset, it costs nothing.
