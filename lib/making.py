PARSEH NEVER STARTS AN AGENT (TO-DO §18, the owner, 2026-09-28).  It prepares a
folder under books/, shows where it is, and the person opens whatever agent they
use on it.  The agent works on the REAL tree -- Parseh's own lib/*.py, run with
Parseh's own Python -- and writes only inside the book's folder, so the book is
in the library from the first minute and can be looked at while it grows.

WHAT THE FOLDER HOLDS beside the book's own files (book.json, main.tex, source/,
annot/, the chapters):

    original/<file>   the source text the book is made from -- in the book's own
                      folder and not in others/, which a release neither ships
                      nor keeps (lib/release.py CONTENT), so it travels with the
                      book (lib/bundle.py)
    NOTES.md          the book's journal: the source's oddities, the decisions
                      taken, what is open.  Kept by whoever makes the book
    ASKS.md           what the person asks of the agent, dated entries, written
                      from the making panel and from the reader's chunk sheet.
                      The agent reads it again before every batch
    making.json       the record of the making, below
    AGENTS.md         the instructions, in words any agent can be told to read
    CLAUDE.md         one line pointing at AGENTS.md, which Claude Code reads
                      by itself
    .claude/skills/parseh-book/, .agents/skills/parseh-book/
                      the same method as a project skill, for the agents that look for one
                      (Claude Code reads the first and not the second; Codex, Gemini CLI,
                      Cursor, GitHub Copilot and VS Code read the second).  Copies and not
                      links, for Windows.  Written by lib/skills.py where it is there

making.json is ONE small object that Parseh and the agent keep between them.
Every field is optional to read -- an agent's file may be half written, and the
panel says so instead of stopping:

    state     "making", or "finished".  PARSEH'S ALONE: written when the folder is
              made and by Finish (finish_start), never by the agent.  Anything but
              "finished" means the book is still being made
    parseh    the version of Parseh the folder was made under; the panel says
              "Parseh was updated during the making" when this Parseh differs
    started   when the folder was made (UTC, 2026-09-29T14:00:12Z)
    finished  when Finish ended the making
    updated   when the AGENT last wrote the file: it writes it every time it
              finishes something
    stage     the agent's: "source" (the original recovered), "chapters" (the
              chapter table written), "batch", "done" (every batch is in),
              "waiting" (every part is in and more is coming: it waits for the next)
    on        the agent's: one line, what it is on now
    chapters  the agent's chapter table: [{"chapter": 1, "paragraphs": 24, "part": 1}, ...]
              ("part", the part its first paragraphs came from, is optional)
    batches   the agent's: {"done": 3, "of": 12}
    checks    the agent's: what the tools last said, {"check_batch": "0 errors",
              "assemble": "ALL PARAGRAPHS CLEAN", "verify_book": "clean"}
    sources   the agent's alone: which parts of the text it has recovered,
              {"done": [1, 2], "of": 3, "decided": {"3": "a new chapter: it opens with a heading"}}
    asks_read the agent's: how many entries of ASKS.md it has read, so that the agent that takes
              over (or the same one, after a pause) starts at the next

THE TEXT COMES IN PARTS (brief 5.10): the person gives it a bit at a time, from any
device, as a file or pasted, and the agent takes each part before its next batch.
These two are PARSEH'S ALONE to write, never the agent's:

    parts       [{"n": 1, "file": "original/part-001-x.pdf", "pages": [0, 9], "chapter":
                "new", "join": "", "label": "", "added": "2026-10-05T10:00:00Z", "bytes":
                1234}, ...] -- the first original is part 1.  `chapter` says where the part
                goes: "auto" (the agent decides from the text and says what it decided in
                `sources.decided`), "new" (a chapter of its own) or "last" (more of the last
                chapter); `join` is "paragraph" when the part was cut in the middle of a
                paragraph and its first paragraph goes on the last one of the part before
    more_coming true while the person may still add text: they say "this is all the text"
                to set it false, and may set it true again

AND THIS ONE, written once when the folder is made, so that "write the instructions again" can
write them the same way (writing them again never touches making.json):

    instructions {"reference": "persian/farsi" or "", "examples": false, "marks": "marks" or
                "nomarks" where the language has them, "prompt": the id of the person's own
                prompt or ""}

WHAT FINISH WAITS FOR is not decided (the owner, 2026-09-29: more detail, next week): it is
ONE function, finish_blockers, and two settings beside it (FINISH_WAITS_FOR,
FINISH_CONFIRMABLE), so that every option the owner is offered is a small change here.

WHILE A BOOK IS BEING MADE its reader does not edit (serve.py refuses LOCKED
doors, lib/making.js says why): the pipeline's truth is annot/*.json and the
.tex is assembled from it, so a hand edit would be erased by the agent's next
assembly.  Finish ends that: the .tex is the truth from then on, and annot/
stays as the record of how it was made.
