"""The reading help: what this computer has fetched to help you read a book
nobody has glossed, at /settings/reading-help/ (TO-DO §11.10).

It used to be its own page, /lookup/, five sections by kind -- dictionaries,
character components, translated sentences, translation models, synonyms --
each a table of rows.  It is a page of Settings now, beside Network, because
it is the same kind of thing as the port and the doors: what this machine
has, set once, from a page.  /lookup/ answers with a redirect to it for good
(serve.py), since every reader built before the move carries that address.

LANGUAGE FIRST.  Nobody wants "a dictionary"; they want to read their
Persian book.  So the page is a card per language -- the ones on your shelf
first, the others one line each until opened -- saying what the language has
and what it could have, with one *get everything* and what that costs.  What
is shared by every language (the translation engine, the English synonyms,
the fallback component pack) has a card of its own.

SHOWN RATHER THAN TOLD.  A row not yet installed carries a small example of
what it adds, drawn the way the reader draws it, in the card's own language:
a dictionary entry, a sentence somebody translated, a machine's reading, a
character taken apart.  EXAMPLES below holds one per kind for every language
the toolbox teaches; a language added later borrows Persian's.

SIZES BEFORE ANYTHING IS FETCHED.  Turkish's extract is 431 MB.  Where a size
has been measured, each downloader ships it (its MEASURED table, read through
its plan(..., probe=False), which sends nothing anywhere) and the row says it
on sight; where it has not, the row says "Parseh says how big before it
starts", and pressing *get it* asks the source for the size, says it, and
asks.  Nothing starts that the disk has no room for (serve.py).

SIX STATES, each a glyph, a word and a colour -- never the colour alone:
installed, built by an older Parseh (a dictionary without the index a newer
one writes, §11.6), downloading or building (a bar that moves, and the time
left), not yet, stopped (with the reason, in words), not available (with
why).  And each row's licence on the row, from the downloaders' own
constants through lib/notices.py, so the row and the Licences page cannot
disagree.

The long explanations this page used to carry -- why a dictionary cannot say
which sense a sentence means, why the model reads the whole sentence -- are
in the guide now ("How the reading help works"), linked from the foot.

Nothing here is required: Parseh gains no dependency and sends nothing
anywhere but the downloads themselves, and a language with nothing installed
is read exactly as it always was.
