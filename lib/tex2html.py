"""Stage 2 — build the audio-synced reader from the same .tex files.

    python3 tex2html.py            -> reader/index.html

Chapter order comes from the \\input lines of the book's main.tex; there is no
list of chapters anywhere else.  Every word of the text, transliteration,
vocabulary and meaning is read out of the .tex at build time and appears in
exactly one place in this program: the chunk it came from.  Passes 3 and 4 are
derived by stripping the language's marks, the same way frank_strip does in
LaTeX.

The page also carries SRC, one entry per chunk in data-c order, holding those
same fields AS THE .tex WRITES THEM.  That is the one deliberate second copy
here, and it is what the edit boxes are filled from: the page shows the
vocabulary rendered (\\dw{water}{ab} becomes two runs and a space), so the
source of that field cannot be read back out of the DOM, and an author handed
the rendering to edit is being handed something that is not in the file.  The
edit itself is the server's -- POST <reader>/__edit/chunk, which validates,
rewrites the one macro call and rebuilds this page -- and the answer, whether
it applied or refused, is shown in the words it arrived in.  A stretch of the
book glossed by an LLM goes through the same door, chunk by chunk: the page
asks <reader>/__region/prompt for the prompt to copy and hands the pasted
answer to <reader>/__region/apply, and lib/glossregion.py decides there, from
the files, what may be written.

The book's language (books.Book.lang, from book.json; Persian when undeclared)
decides everything that is not layout: the lang/dir attributes, which passes
exist and what the buttons say, the digits of the labels, how a chunk splits
into words, whether pass 1 carries a reading (<ruby>) and the gloss a kana
line, the font tokens the stylesheet reads (--tl-font, --tl-alt, from
/lib/langs.css keyed by data-lang on <html>).  Nothing in this file names a
language: the record is embedded as LANG for the script, and the CSS is
written against dir attributes and the tokens.

The book's SECOND language is what its glosses are written in
(books.Book.gloss_lang, book.json's "gloss"; English when it says nothing,
which is every book written before the field existed).  It decides what the
gloss row and the two sheets carry -- their lang and dir, and the name the
meaning field wears -- and it is embedded as GLOSS beside LANG.  The two are
different questions: an Italian learning English reads English chunks glossed
in Italian (docs/languages.md section 3).

   it: a run of twelve paragraphs could be hiding six notes and the page
   said nothing at all.  The bar says it now -- the marks of every note
   inside the run, under the button, the first three and then "+N more",
   which opens the rest where it stands.  The row goes when the run is
   opened (the sheet's `.foldbar.open .fnotes`), because every one of those
   notes is then standing in its own seam again, where it belongs.

   FOUND BY WALKING THE PAGE, not by comparing keys.  Each mark already
   carries the note it was made for; what this asks is which marks are
   inside the paragraphs this bar has hidden, so what the bar shows is
   exactly what was hidden -- including a note whose anchor points at a seam
   the reader has no paragraph for, which is nobody's and stays adrift at
   the end of the book as it always did.

/* ---------- the book as an outline, to pick a stretch of it from ----------
   Three sheets name a part of the book: what a recording covers, what is
   folded away, where a section opens.  Each used to do it with a list of
   every paragraph -- or every subparagraph -- of the book, twice over,
   labelled by number alone: hundreds of rows to scroll through in a
   textbook, and nothing to know a paragraph by.  This is the one control the
   three share instead: the book as it is built, chapters holding their
   sections holding their paragraphs (and, for a recording, their
   subparagraphs), each paragraph shown by its number AND its opening words,
   in the book's own script.  It is read off the contents tree the build
   wrote, and off SUBS for the subparagraphs, so it cannot disagree with the
   contents panel about what the book holds.

   A CLICK TAKES A WHOLE THING -- a chapter, a section, a paragraph -- because
   most of what anybody names is exactly one of those: a recording is of a
   chapter, what gets folded is a section, a section opens at a paragraph.
   Clicking what is already picked opens it, to go finer.  A SHIFT-CLICK
   STRETCHES the pick from the last thing clicked to this one, as every list
   on a desktop does; "stretch it to…" does the same for a finger, or for
   anybody who has never heard of shift-clicking: the next thing picked is
   where it ends.  What is picked is tinted, its two ends say so, and the
   line under the outline says it in words.  The keys are a tree's (the
   WAI-ARIA pattern): the arrows walk it and open and close, Enter or Space
   picks, with Shift they stretch; the box above finds a paragraph by its
   number or its words.

   `o`: depth ('para' | 'sub', what a pick is made of), point (one thing,
   not a stretch), whole (nothing picked means the whole book, and says so),
   can(row) (may it be picked), tags(row) -> [[text, class, title]],
   redirect(row) (the row a click on this one picks), onChange(pick),
   label, hint.  A pick is {lo, hi, row} in the units of `depth`: contents
   entries, in reading order, or SUBS indices.                              */

   Sometimes the recording is what is wanted and the text is not: put it on
   and listen, from wherever in the file you like.

   BUT A FOLD IS STILL A FOLD.  A run somebody folded away is text they have
   said they do not want; played straight through it would be read out all the
   same.  So listening holds at the first folded stretch ahead of it, and
   leaves the playhead at the END of that stretch -- ready to go on after it
   at the next press, which is what somebody who folded it meant, while the
   seek bar is right there for somebody who meant otherwise.

   The gate is worked out in the CURRENT recording's clock.  A book read from
   several files has one loaded at a time, and a stretch recorded in another

/* ---------- listening, with the mark let back in -------------------------
   Listening on its own never touches the mark (hl/clearHL): that is the
   whole of what it promises above, and most of the time it is enough --
   "not necessary, everything works without it".  "follow" is the one door
   back in, for whoever wants to see where the recording has got to without
   giving up the hands-free play: it puts the mark on the subparagraph the
   PLAYHEAD is in, the way a video's captions follow the video (tick() /
   findSeg() in youtube/lib/player.js, read the same way here) -- not the
   way a book's own \stopAt does, which pauses at the end of one.  Following
   never sets stopAt and never touches `cur`: the reading place you left off
   at is exactly where it was, and turning "follow" off, or listening off,
   puts the mark back on it (restoreHL).

   "scroll to it" is the second, and only ever means anything together with
   the first: on its own, with nothing being followed, there is nothing to
   scroll to.  Off, the mark still moves under "follow" -- the page does
   not, and the reader follows it by hand.  Both are grey until listening is
   on, and both start unpressed every time listening is turned on, the same
   "a habit of the moment" listening itself is. */

   A source of last resort, drawn in a borrowed panel and under one rule: IT
   IS NOT A GLOSS.  A gloss is somebody's judgement about this word in this
   sentence; a dictionary lists every sense the word can ever have and cannot
   say which is meant.  So it is ruled off, tinted, labelled with where it
   came from, and offered only where nobody has written a vocabulary line.
   It has its own switch in the header, and the switch defaults OFF: a reader
   who does not want it never sees it, and the page makes no request.

   The panel is built here and filled asynchronously, because the cloud must
   open at once and a lookup is a round trip.  Every answer is stamped with
   the chunk it was asked for and dropped if the cloud has moved on, which it

   DEFINITION: `house` is "a structure serving as an abode of human beings",
   written in the very language the reader is learning and not necessarily
   one they can read yet.  So where the server says the dictionary defines its
   words in their own language (`definitions`), the definitions are a switch
   of their own, OFF until it is turned on, and an entry without them still
   says everything else it knows: the headword, how it is said, its part of
   speech, how the word was reached, a verb's parts.  On, every sense is there
   -- the first three, the rest one click away -- with the labels Wiktionary
   puts on it (transitive, countable, slang).  A second switch, where a
   translation model reads this pair, puts each definition into the language

/* ---------- the narration panel: the recordings of this book -------------
   THE SUBJECT HERE IS THE LIST OF RECORDINGS.  A book has one, or a dozen,
   each covering a stretch of the text; everything that can be done to one is
   done in ITS OWN ROW, and what is left for the head is what is true of the
   book: how much of it is timed, adding a recording, and the narration file
   that carries the lot to another copy.

   THERE IS ONE ALIGN AND IT IS ON THE ROW.  The whole-book button this panel
   used to lead with could not work on a book recorded in parts -- with no
   recording named, lib/timestamp.py exits "say which one to align" -- and on
   a book with ONE recording the row is the book, since books.py reads the old
   scalars as a single recording called n1.  So the button is gone, not moved,
   and every align posts {narration: id}.

   Answered by the server this page is served from (relative URLs, like
   __save/, so the server knows which book).  Most doors end by rebuilding the
   reader, and this page has TIMES/SUBS/NARR/META baked into it: from the
   first such change what is on screen is from before, which is what the bar
   at the top of the list says.  Opened from the disk none of it can work, and
   the panel says so instead of failing quietly, control by control.       */

/* DELETE A GLOSS, AND TAKE THE DELETE BACK.  One press empties the chunk's
   transliteration, vocabulary and meaning, and its reading where it has one,
   through the door a save goes through: texwrite lets every box of a gloss be
   emptied at once -- it refuses emptying ONE box a language requires, which
   would leave half a gloss -- and what is left is a chunk nobody has glossed
   yet, which the checkers count and do not complain of.  The text, the colour
   and the word line stay, and so does the macro: a \chw keeps its words, and
   a \chp has no gloss to delete and is not offered the button.

   NO QUESTION FIRST, BECAUSE THERE IS AN ANSWER AFTER.  The gloss as it was
   is kept in this page, and "undo delete" writes it back through the same
   door, where filling boxes is never refused.  In a Map and not in storage,
   until the page is reloaded: an undo that outlived the page would be offered
   against a file that may have been rewritten since.  Keyed by the chunk's
   number AND its text, because dividing renumbers every chunk after it, and a
   number alone could put one chunk's gloss back onto another.  Reopening the
   sheet on the chunk later offers it again; the region sheet's fill does not
   touch it (an LLM's gloss can be undone into the one that was deleted).

   A GLOSS IS WHAT SOMEBODY WROTE.  In a language divided into words a draft
   gives each chunk its reading from its word line, and while it still says
   exactly that nobody wrote it: the checkers and the edit door count the
   chunk as unglossed, and so does this button -- greyed out, rather than
   offering to delete a proposal that the region prompt would otherwise
   send.  The build marks the row of such a chunk with that reading
   (data-seed, tex2html.seeded, from lib/wordline.py's own seed), and a write
   brings the mark up to date with the rest of the row (paintFrom).  Asked
   of the whole chunk only: beside anything else written, the reading is the

/* ---------- a stretch of the book glossed by an LLM -----------------------
   The chunk sheet writes one chunk by hand; this sheet writes many from a
   chatbot's answer.  Three steps, each a button of its own: PICK a stretch
   -- the outline every stretch of this book is picked from, at the depth of a
   sentence (a subparagraph, one \parnum): click, shift-click, or "stretch it
   to…"; COPY THE PROMPT, which the server writes -- the chunks of those
   sentences as they stand in the .tex, each marked to be glossed or sent as
   it is -- and the page puts on the clipboard; and, once the chatbot has
   answered, FILL FROM THE ANSWER.

   THE PAGE DECIDES NOTHING ABOUT WHAT MAY BE WRITTEN.  lib/glossregion.py
   works that out when the answer lands, from the chapter files as they are
   then: a chunk somebody has glossed is kept unless re-gloss is ticked; a
   chunk whose text is not what the page shows, or that the answer divides
   differently, or that it would leave half glossed, is dropped and listed; a
   paragraph folded away is never written; and every chunk that does go in
   goes in through texwrite.edit_chunk, the chunk sheet's own door.  What the
   page does is send the stretch and the two boxes as they stand when fill is
   pressed, show the server's words whole, and paint what was written where it
   is -- with no reload, which would lose the answer box and every "undo
   delete" this page is holding.

   The stretch goes to the server as the book-wide chunk numbers the chunk
   sheet uses (data-c): the first chunk of the first sentence picked and the
   last of the last, read off the .sub elements -- which is why a chapter
   still in its own file is fetched first.  The server widens a pick to whole
   sentences in any case, and says in words what it took.                  */

/* One dictionary hit, as a row and the buttons that put it into a field.

   THE LEMMA WITH THE LEMMA'S OWN SOUND.  `translit` is the romanisation of
   the form the lookup reached, which is what the transliteration box wants
   -- the chunk's romanisation is of the words on the page -- and it is the
   wrong half of a \dw: pressing the button on ساختن reached from می‌سازم
   used to write \dw{ساختن}{mi-sāzam}, the lemma with the inflected form's
   sound.  head_sound is the lemma's; a server that does not send it yet
   falls back to the pronunciation, and only then to translit.

   AS THIS BOOK SPELLS IT.  Wiktionary files Chinese under the traditional
   characters, so a hit reached from 帮忙 in a simplified book comes back
   headed 幫忙, and its \dw wrote a word the book never prints.  Where lookup
   knows the spelling the book uses it sends `spelled`; the row and the \dw
   take that, and the dictionary's headword only when there is none.

   A VERB GOES IN AS \vb.  Where the language's recipe knew the hit for a
   verb it sends h.vb, the whole \vb ready to insert, and that button stands
   where \dw did; a \vb the book has already written for the same verb is
   offered before it.  A \vb the dictionary could not complete still goes in,
   dashed, with the row saying what is left.

   THE \vb CAN BE ANOTHER VERB'S.  German puts a separated verb back
   together: `stand … auf` reaches stehen, and the \vb its recipe builds is
   aufstehen's, whose `pret. stand auf` would sit under "stehen" unexplained.
   So the row names the verb the \vb is for -- stehen → aufstehen -- and the
   same arrow shows a reflexive (freuen → sich freuen, lever → se lever), a
   compound's light verb (teşekkür etmek → etmek) and a suru verb (勉強 →
   勉強する).  Compared with the marks off: an Arabic hit is headed by its
   bare page title, كتب, and its \vb by the vowelled كَتَبَ -- one verb, and
   compared as written, every Arabic verb would wear an arrow to itself.

   WHAT IS LEFT, IN FULL AND ONE TO A LINE.  An item of `missing` can be a
   sentence with its own colon: Persian's compound leaves `bw for فکر fekr
   after it: to think`, Turkish's passive `meaning: the dictionary has
   yapılmak only as the passive of yapmak`.  Joined with commas, two of those
   read as one run-on list whose colons belong to nobody, so every item is a
   line of its own, on the row and in the button's title, and none is cut.
   Nor does the title say "it goes in blank" any more: the \bw a compound
   needs is a thing to ADD, not a slot left empty.

   A HINT IS NOT A GAP.  `notes` is what the recipe found and could not
   choose between -- Arabic's other masdars: 1,122 of 7,233 verb entries
   list two to seven, and which one is meant depends on the sense -- so it is
   shown under the line, dimmer, and is neither `missing` nor in the title:
   the \vb is complete, the hint is only worth a second look. */

/* ---------- where a chunk ends -------------------------------------------
   A chunk is a sense group, and the groups an LLM cut on its first pass are
   the first thing somebody who knows the language wants to move.  Two
   operations, one sheet above the chunk sheet:

     JOIN this chunk to the next one.  The texts go end to end with the
     language's word separator, so the paragraph reproduces its source
     character for character and no check can fail; everything else -- the
     romanisation, the vocabulary, the meaning -- is put end to end with the
     separator its own field uses, and the server says in a note whatever
     could not simply be run together (two colours, two meanings).

     CUT it in two.  The only places offered are the places the text divides:
     a space, for a language written with spaces, and any two characters for
     one without.  What goes to which half is then a judgement, and the sheet
     is where it is made -- the vocabulary entries arrive on the side whose
     text holds their headword and move across with an arrow, and every box
     is typed over freely.

   The proposals are worked out by the server (lib/chunkdiv.py) and drawn
   here, so the video player's sheet and this one are one set of rules shown
   twice rather than two sets that drift.  Nothing is written until the button
   is pressed, and what is written is what is in the boxes.

   AFTERWARDS THE PAGE IS STALE, and this is the whole reason the sheet does
   not simply close.  data-c runs across the book, so joining or cutting moves
   every chunk after it by one; the per-chunk repaint cannot see that and the
   numbers left in this page would address the wrong text.  So the sheet turns
   into the outcome and one button, which reloads.  A page reloaded late is
   safe as well: every divide sends the text it is looking at, and the server
   refuses when the file no longer says that. */

/* ---------- notes: what the book does not have room to say -----------------
   A reading edition is a text and its gloss, and there is nowhere in it to
   say the other thing -- that this idiom is the one from chapter two, that
   the next four lines are a quotation.  A note is that: a markdown file in
   the seam between two lines, kept in the book's own folder under markdown/
   and written with the studio's editor.

   IT IS NOT SHOWN IN THE PAGE.  The reading is the point, and a page that
   put an essay between two subparagraphs would not be a reading edition any
   more.  What is shown is that there is one -- a small mark in the seam --
   and clicking it opens the note over the whole page, rendered by the
   studio's own renderer in a frame.  Rendered by it, not like it: the
   marks, the glossary, the colours and the typography are the studio's
   because it IS the studio, mounted over this book's markdown/ directory.

   WHAT IT OPENS IS THE BARE PAGE (markdown/app/templates/note.html): the
   rendered note on the studio's sheet, with no editor and none of the
   studio's scripts.  The document page it used to open was about 1.3 MB
   fetched afresh on every click, for a page that is read a dozen times in a
   session and written on almost never; "open in the studio", in the bare
   page's own header, is one click from the whole of it, and a note that
   holds an exercise is sent there by the server without being asked.

   The seams are written into the page at build time (one `.gap` before every
   subparagraph, one after the last); what is IN them is asked for at runtime,
   because notes are written and retitled without rebuilding a book.

   An anchor naming a subparagraph that is no longer there -- the text was
   rewritten, or the note was moved by hand to a key that does not exist --
   is not dropped and not an error: the note is shown at the end of the book
   under `adrift`, which is where somebody will look for it. */

   The same bargain the chapters already make (fillChapter's observer): a
   note whose mark comes near the window is read now, so that the click that
   opens it costs nothing.  It is held as text and put into the frame with
   srcdoc, rather than left to the browser's cache, because the studio
   answers `no-cache` for everything it renders -- a page somebody may be
   editing must never come back stale -- and a revalidation over a tunnel is
   the very wait this is here to remove.

   CAPPED, because a textbook has hundreds of notes and a reader walking it
   would otherwise carry every one of them for the rest of the session; the
   oldest goes when the cap is reached, and it is only ever a copy of
   something the server still has.

   NEVER WHILE A NOTE IS OPEN.  The note being read is what the connection
   is for; anything that came near meanwhile waits and goes when it closes.

   A NOTE THAT HOLDS AN EXERCISE is not held at all.  The server answers the
   bare address for one with a redirect to the studio's full page (an
   exercise with no script is a box that cannot be answered), and `redirected`
   is how that is known here: the id is remembered, and from then on it is
   opened as the full page directly, without the extra hop.

   AND AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER THERE IS NO REDIRECT TO SEE.  A kept book keeps
   its notes, and for a note that holds an exercise what was kept IS the
   studio's full page -- so it can be answered on a train, exactly as it is at
   the desk (TO-DO §0, "the notes, kept with their book or video").  The
   worker hands that page straight back at the bare address, without a hop,
   and `redirected` is false: a test that believed it would put a document
   page, scripts and all, into the frame through srcdoc, where a bare note
   was expected.  So the page is asked what it is as well.  The studio writes
   that on its own <body> -- `data-page="doc"` on the document page,
   `data-page="note"` on the bare one -- which is an honest answer whoever
   gave it, and one the renderer can never forge: everything a note's own
   text contributes to this html went through htmlgen's escaping. */

/* ---------- a look at a note before it is opened ---------------------------
   The mark is the title cut to one line, and opening the note puts the
   studio over the whole page: to learn what a note said, a reader had to
   leave the text.  So a pointer resting on a mark (or the keyboard's focus
   arriving at one) shows the title and the note's first lines, in a card
   beside the mark, after a moment -- 350 ms, long enough that sweeping the
   pointer across a seam on the way to a word does not light up every note
   it crosses.  It goes on leaving, on a click anywhere, on Escape, on a
   scroll (the card is fixed and the mark is not), and when the note opens.

   PLAIN TEXT, AND ONLY EVER textContent.  A note is a file that travels:
   it comes inside a book's bundle, from somebody else's toolbox, and its
   title and its excerpt (which /api/marks cuts from its markdown, markup
   and front matter stripped) are that person's words.  A click on the mark
   already runs the note's page in a frame; a pointer merely passing over
   one must never do more than show letters.

   NONE ON A TOUCH SCREEN (HOVER_OK), where there is no hover to rest: a tap
   opens the note, as it always did.  The card is made here, by the script,
   and not written into the page: a reader built before it has none, and

    opened for one chunk, closed by Escape.  WHICH rows it shows is decided in
    the browser and not here -- \\chp carries a colour and its text and nothing
    else, and the page can see that from the row the build wrote for it.

    The fields wear the language's own names (the registry's translit_label
    and reading_label): a Japanese chunk's tr is its rōmaji and an Italian
    one's is a pronunciation, and neither is called a transliteration.  The
    vocabulary says out loud that it is LaTeX, because it is the one field
    that is, and shows the macros with the arity nobody remembers.

    The last row wears the GLOSS language's name (meaning_label above), and
    its box takes that language's direction: an annotator told to write the
    meanings in Italian is told so again by the box they are typed into, and
    a Persian gloss of an Arabic text is typed right to left.

    The \\vb button says what ITS language's three forms are, from the
    registry's vb_forms: it said "infinitive, pres. stem, past stem" in every
    book, which is Persian's \\vb and nobody else's -- an Arabic verb is filed
    under its perfect, a Japanese one under its dictionary form, and the
    third Italian form is a participle and not a stem.  A registry without
    vb_forms falls back to the two labels the gloss itself prints.  The three
    are joined with a middle dot because an item may hold a comma of its
    own (Arabic's first is "perfect, 3rd m. sg., ...").

    Beside save and revert, "delete gloss" empties every box of the gloss in
    one press and "undo delete" writes it back (the page keeps it until it
    is reloaded); a chunk left like that is one nobody has glossed yet, legal
    everywhere.  The "an LLM" row opens the region sheet (#rgbox, after the
    fold sheet here, from the header's "gloss with an LLM" too) on this
    chunk's sentence: a prompt for a chatbot copied, its answer pasted back

      <div class="anote"><b>A recording, and the stretch of text it is of.</b> A book can
        be read a part at a time: each file says which subparagraphs it covers, each is
        timed on its own, and re-timing one touches nothing else. A book read in one
        sitting is one recording covering the whole book, which is what every book had
        before this existed.</div>
      <div class="anote"><b>A transcript is a time index, never a text:</b> not a word of
        it goes into the book. Any of: YouTube's transcript panel copied whole
        (<i>&hellip; more &rsaquo; Show transcript</i>, click into the panel, select all,
        copy &mdash; the &ldquo;N seconds&rdquo; lines can stay); an <code>.srt</code> or
        <code>.vtt</code>; or, for a recording of your own, whisper's output:
        <code>whisper narration.m4a --language %s --output_format srt</code>
        (<code>pip install openai-whisper</code>). It belongs to one recording: a book in
        parts has one transcript per part, saved from that part's own row.</div>
      <div class="anote"><b>align</b> needs that transcript. The transcript says roughly
        <i>when</i>, the text says <i>what</i>, the cuts are snapped to the silences in the
        audio, and the times go into the <code>.tex</code> as comments and into
        <code>timings.json</code>. A whole novel takes a minute or two.
        <b>estimate times</b> needs no transcript at all: it shares the recording out over
        the stretch it covers in proportion to the length of each subparagraph &mdash; a
        first guess to play and to nudge, which a real alignment later replaces without
        being asked twice. Needs <span id="ntools">&hellip;</span>.</div>
      <div class="anote"><b>Then.</b> Every timed subparagraph plays on a click, &#9654;
        and the arrow keys walk through them, and <b>edit times</b> in the header fixes
        any that drift, or stamps the ones that have no time yet.</div>
      <div class="anote"><b>Keeping it.</b> <b>export</b> writes the audio, the
        transcript, the times and a manifest into one file, to keep beside the book or to
        hand to another reader of the same edition; <b>import</b> takes such a file on
        another copy and lays it over this book's audio, transcript and
        <code>timings.json</code> &mdash; the times fixed by hand included &mdash; keeping
        the previous <code>timings.json</code> beside it as
