        tag, not a rehearsal's -- both carry the day it is released
    python3 lib/release.py guide [--ref REF]
        refuses unless the compiled guide (html-guide/site/) was compiled
        from the sources there are now
    python3 lib/release.py prerelease TAG
        "true" for a rehearsal's tag, "false" for a version's: how GitHub
        is to mark the draft
    python3 lib/release.py compare A B
        whether two builds -- two zips, two manifests, or one of each -- ship
        the same files; a zip is first held to its own manifest

A DEVELOPER'S TOOL.  Releasing is a developer's act, so this is a command of
one line; nobody who uses Parseh ever runs it.  docs/releasing.md says when
to run which.

ONE BUILDER.  GitHub builds a release when a tag is pushed
(.github/workflows/release.yml runs `check` and `guide`, then `build`), and
the developer builds the very same zip on his own machine before any tag
exists: to install it, find a fault, fix it and build the same number
again.  Both run this file, because a local build made any other way would
prove nothing about CI's.

WHAT A RELEASE IS.  `git archive` of one commit, less what .gitattributes
marks export-ignore.  Only what is committed: a file changed or made since,
and not committed, is not in it, and a build from HEAD names every such file
so that nobody installs a fix that is not there.  The zip is written here,
in Python, from git archive's tar, not by `git archive --format=zip`: that
would need --add-virtual-file to put the manifest in, which an older git (a
CI runner's, say) lacks, and each git version would make the zip's entries
its own way.  Here they are made one way everywhere: Unix modes, so
install.sh and serve.sh stay runnable once unzipped; the commit's time on
every entry and the commit's id as the zip's comment, as git's own zip has;
the same compression.  Git runs with what could make two machines disagree
switched off -- core.autocrlf (a Windows git's default would turn every text
file CRLF), core.eol, tar.umask, a personal or a system-wide attributes file
-- so the bytes are the commit's as .gitattributes shapes them: the .bat
files CRLF, since cmd.exe misreads bare LF, and every other file as
committed.

THE MANIFEST, .parseh-release.json in the zip's one folder, beside
install.sh, and so at the root of every install made from it:

    {"format": "parseh-release/1",
     "version": "<VERSION at that commit, or the rehearsal's tag built>",
     "commit": "<the commit's full id>",
     "built": "<the commit's time, UTC, ISO 8601>",
     "data_formats": {<lib/version.formats() of that tree>},
     "environment": {"conda": {"<name>": "<the line environment.yml gives>"},
                     "pip":   {"<name>": "<the line environment.yml gives>"}},
     "files": {"<path from the install's root>":
                   {"sha256": "<hex>", "size": <bytes>, "mode": "0644" | "0755"}}}

It is made FROM THE ARCHIVE, after export-ignore has had its say, so it can
never disagree with what ships: every file of the zip is in "files" (all but
the manifest itself), hashed as archived.  A .bat is hashed as its CRLF
bytes, which is what an unpacked install holds; git's own blob ids are of
the LF text and would never match it.  "built" is the commit's time and not
the clock's, so two builds of one commit make the same manifest -- and, where
the two machines' zlib agree, the same zip.  "data_formats" and
"environment" are what an update from Settings (TO-DO §13.16) compares: to
know whether a step back may lose data, and whether the environment must
change.  Both are read from the archived tree itself, by its own
lib/version.py and its own lib/runtime.env_spec, in a separate Python that
sees nothing else -- so they are that commit's, whatever checkout builds it,
and whatever they need has to be the standard library, since CI has nothing
more.  No release without one: the builder puts the manifest in the zip or
writes no zip.

WHAT A BUILD REFUSES: the traps that have bitten somebody, checked on the
archive itself, so that a careless edit of .gitattributes fails here and not
in somebody's install (audit() below; tests/test_release.py holds
.gitattributes' own list):
  - a folder Parseh writes into, missing -- git archive keeps no empty
    folder, and clips/README.md, exercises/README.md and the .gitkeeps are
    why they exist -- or a file a release cannot do without;
  - a .bat with a bare LF, or a launcher that lost its executable bit;
  - anything personal and any content (TO-DO §18: Parseh ships none): .tls/,
    and in config/, books/, youtube/videos/, markdown/library/, exercises/,
    clips/, youtube/anki/, dict/, corpus/, mt/ and components/ anything but
    a .gitkeep or a README.md;
  - tests/, or a GIF in docs/, which export-ignore keeps out;
  - a link (Windows unpacks one as a small text file), or a committed
    .parseh-release.json.

THE CHANGELOG.  CHANGELOG.md's headings read "## [aX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD",
newest first, with "unreleased" in place of the date until release day, and
lib/changelog.py is the one reader of them: `notes` cuts a release's notes
with it, word for word, and `check` holds the newest heading to VERSION and
the tag with it, so a heading the guide's test accepts is one a release
accepts.  The guide's What's new says the same versions on the same days in
its own words, and is read by the same module; `check` holds the tagged
version's heading there too, since CI runs no test suite (the owner,
2026-09-25) and a release whose guide still says "not yet released" would
ship saying so.  VERSION is read by lib/version.py, its one reader, and
compared by its one rule.

REHEARSALS (the owner, 2026-09-25).  A release is tried out on GitHub first
under a rehearsal's tag, `aX.Y.Z-rcN` (lib/version.py's rule 4: it sorts
before aX.Y.Z), while VERSION and both headings already say aX.Y.Z:
`check` passes it with the headings still undated, `build --tag` names the
zip, its folder and its manifest's version by the tag, and the workflow
marks its draft a prerelease, which GitHub's "latest" -- what Settings asks
for -- never answers with.  The draft and the tag are deleted once looked
at, and the version's own tag follows (docs/releasing.md).

THE GUIDE.  html-guide/site/ is committed, compiled, and ships as it is: a
release never compiles it.  `guide` refuses when the sources a compile reads
-- the pages and their pictures, the engine, the studio's renderer (the
engine's own fingerprint.py says which) -- are not what the committed
site/build.json was compiled from, or when that compile had errors; asked
of the tree's own engine in a Python of its own, as the data formats are.

Standard library only: CI runs it with a bare Python.
