"""/later/: every chunk a person flagged to review later, across every book
and video (a0.5.0).

The page the hub's "Review later" door opens.  It lists the flags grouped by
book or video -- the title, the language, how many -- each with the chunk, its
gloss, where it is and how long ago it was flagged, and a link that opens the
book or the video AT the chunk (`<reader path>#later=<id>`, `<player
path>#later=<id>`: the reader and the player open their own list on that
item and go to it).  "Test myself" and "Copy the list" work here as they do
in a book's own sidebar.

THE PAGE IS AN EMPTY FRAME.  What is in it is drawn by lib/later.js from the
door (/__later) AND from the device's own copy, so it is live, it lists what a
phone flagged away from the computer, and it opens with the computer away: the
frame is in the phone's offline shell (lib/offline.py, SHELL_PAGES) and the
flags are in its localStorage.

BOTH LAYOUTS IN ONE PAGE, as the licences are (lib/notices.py): the bar is
written twice, `data-layout="browser"` and `data-layout="mobile"`, and one
column under it serves both -- rows a finger's height under the mobile mode
(lib/later.css).  Nothing on it edits a book or a video: removing a flag, and
the list itself, are the person's own and the phone may do them.
