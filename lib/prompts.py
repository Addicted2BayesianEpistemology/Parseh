"""Your own prompts (brief §8, a0.4.2): the ones a person writes for the places
Parseh hands a prompt to a chatbot, kept, chosen and passed between computers.

A PROMPT OF YOUR OWN is text with a name, for one SURFACE (lib/promptkit.py
SURFACES: the studio's page and its exercises, a video from scratch, a stretch
of a video or of a book, the transcript tidy, Ask LLM, a book made by an
agent), of one of two KINDS:

    added     goes AFTER Parseh's instructions -- "never gloss proper names",
              "prefer British spellings".  What a new one is, unless said.
    replace   stands IN PLACE of Parseh's instructions.  A new one begins as a
              copy of them, so that nothing is written from a blank page.

Either way what Parseh READS BACK stays Parseh's: the answer contract and the
data come after the person's text, LOCKED, and the kit puts them there
(promptkit.assemble(instructions=...)), so an answer to a prompt of yours
lands exactly as one to Parseh's own.  Two surfaces have nothing Parseh reads
back -- Ask LLM, and a book made by an agent -- and there the whole text may
be the person's.  Parseh's own prompt is not in this store at all, which is
what makes it impossible to delete or overwrite from here.

WHAT A ROUTE ASKS FOR is `prompt=<id>`, never a name (a name is what a person
calls it and may change): resolve() finds the prompt, judges that it is for
this surface and this language, and hands back the instructions to give the
kit and the name the version line then carries (`· custom: <name>`).

KEPT BY THE COMPUTER, in config/prompts.json, in the shape of STORE_FORMAT and
written whole through a temporary file beside it (lib/latexthemes.py's way).
config/ is content: an update never touches it, and an older Parseh does not
know the file.  Writing it changes nothing Parseh will run -- what a chatbot is
told is text a person copies -- so any device let in may (lib/settingspage.py,
`prompts.save` and `prompts.delete`).  A prompt is exported as a file of its
own, in the shape of EXPORT_FORMAT, and imported from one.

KEEPING UP WITH PARSEH (brief §8.7).  A prompt of kind replace remembers
which prompt of Parseh's it began from -- the surface, a short hash of the
instructions text the kit gives it (`version`), and the text itself -- so that
when Parseh's own has changed since, the row can say so and show what changed
(verdict, diff).  The hash and not the release number: the words change in
development while the release number stays.

THE STUDIO'S OLD PROMPT.  Before a0.4.2 the studio kept ONE custom prompt as a
file, markdown/library/_prompt.md.  move_studio_file() carries it into this
store, once, as the prompt "my studio prompt (from before a0.4.2)"; the store
holds the marker, so the file's return (an older Parseh writing it again) is
never moved a second time.

Standard library only, and no page in it: lib/promptspage.py draws Settings'
door, and both route layers (serve.py, markdown/app/server.py) call api().
