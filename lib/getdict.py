The source is Wiktionary, through Tatu Ylönen's extracts at kaikki.org: one
JSONL file per language, the same shape for all eleven, so there is one
converter here and not eleven.  The URL is derived from the registry's English
name (lib/languages.json) -- nothing in this file is a list of languages.

WHY NOT SHIP THE RESULT.  A built dictionary is tens or hundreds of MB
depending on the language -- Persian 21 MB, German 342 MB, as built on
2026-09-10 -- it is somebody else's work under somebody else's licence, and the
repository has always shipped the doors and none of the content.  So
dict/ is in .gitignore, a language with no file simply has no lookup, and
both readers say so rather than breaking.  The licence travels IN the file,
in its meta table, and both readers print it under the entries.

WHAT IS KEPT, AND WHY SO LITTLE.  A Wiktionary entry carries etymology,
pronunciation, hyphenation, categories, a dozen translations and the wikitext
it came from.  A reader hovering over a word in a book wants the headword,
how it sounds, what part of speech it is and what it means.  Keeping the
rest would multiply the file by ten and be shown to nobody.

WHAT MAKES IT WORK is the third table.  Wiktionary lists inflected forms --
both as `forms` on a lemma and as pages of their own saying "genitive
singular of X" -- and those become `form` rows pointing at the lemma.  That
is most of the morphology of all eleven languages, already done, and it is
why lib/lookup.py needs so few rules of its own.  What the rows cannot hold
is a word with something written onto it -- Arabic's و ب ل and object
pronouns (وَقَالَ, أُرِيدُهُ), the French and Italian elisions (s'approcha,
l'uomo), Italian's enclitics (lavorarlo) -- and the forms a source leaves
out of its tables: Persian's object enclitics and its past tense (202 of
the 471 one-word infinitives in the 2026-09-10 fa.db have no past row at
all), Japanese's て and た forms, Italian's agreeing participles.  Those
five languages have a lib/lang/<code>.lookup.json of rules, and so does
Chinese, with no rule in it: it says which spelling is the word's own and
which senses are another lect's.  German, English, Spanish, Hindi and
Turkish have none.

    THE AUXILIARY OF THIS MEANING.  German gives it per sense, at the end of
    the raw gloss: aufstehen `to get up [auxiliary sein]` but `to be open
    [auxiliary haben or sein]`.  kaikki strips it from `glosses`, so the only
    record of which auxiliary a dual verb takes in which meaning -- 201 of
    the 466 such lemmas settled by it -- was lost.  Kept as `aux:sein`,
    `aux:haben`, `aux:haben/sein`.

    THE OBJECT IT GOVERNS.  `{{+obj}}` in `info_templates`: helfen `dat`,
    warten `:auf(acc)`, Arabic `:إِلَى/acc<somewhere>`.  Kept as `obj:` and
    the template's own argument, commas made semicolons, because the line
    it goes into is comma-joined.

    THE CASE A TURKISH VERB TAKES, which Wiktionary writes as prose in the
    qualifier: `[with dative]`, `(intransitive, with ablative case)`, `(with
    -den)`, `(with ile or instrumental)`.  Kept as `with-dative` and so on,
    the spelling wiktextract itself uses where it did tag one.  Measured on
    the first sense of 2 560 Turkish verbs: 83 said what they govern from
    what was kept before, 145 with these.

    """Every spelling of this lemma the source lists, with what each is.

    Two things are not in the `forms` list and have to be fetched from
    elsewhere or thrown away, and both were found by reading Japanese:

    THE READING IS IN THE HEAD TEMPLATE.  `犬` lists canonical, romanization,
    counter and an alternative kanji -- and not `いぬ`, which is how the word
    is actually written half the time.  It is in `head_templates[].args["1"]`,
    by Wiktionary's own convention for a language whose script needs one.
    Without it a kana-written sentence -- which is what a children's story
    is, and what a beginner reads -- matches nothing at all.

    An arg is taken only when every character of it is in the language's own
    script and it is not the word itself.  That is what keeps this general:
    a Latin-script language has no `chars` and contributes nothing, a
    romanisation is Latin and is excluded, and a gender or a number in some
    other language's template cannot look like a spelling.

    A FORM OF AN UNSPACED LANGUAGE CANNOT CONTAIN A SPACE.  `住む` came out
    with a "form" of `住む intransitive godan` -- the headword LINE, not a
    word -- which no lookup can ever match and which is pure weight.

    ONE ROW PER SPELLING AND MEANING, NOT PER SPELLING.  The same string is
    very often two forms -- walked is the past AND the past participle,
    German besucht the third person present AND the participle, èssere the
    canonical headword AND its own auxiliary -- and keeping only the first
    tag set lost the second.  Measured before this changed: the English past
    found for 8% of verbs instead of 99%, German's `participle past` gone on
    28% of verbs, Italian's essere and avere with no auxiliary row at all.
    Identical rows (the five Persian tables share their tags) still go.
    lookup._hits_for folds the several notes of one entry into one hit, so
    the reader still sees one entry.

    BUT THE HEAD LINE OUTRANKS THE TABLE FOR ONE SPELLING.  The head line
    (rows with no `source`) is what the page's editors wrote about the word;
    the conjugation table after it (`source: conjugation`) is generated, and
    says less: prendere's head line has `èssere` as `also auxiliary` -- only
    in the meaning "to happen unexpectedly" -- and its table has the same
    `èssere` as plain `auxiliary`, which read alone says prendere takes
    essere.  Spanish `tengo` is the head's `first-person present singular`
    and again the table's, Arabic يَذْهَبُ the head's `non-past` and again
    the table's third person.  So a table row whose spelling the head line
    already gave is left out, exactly as it always was; what (form, note)
    keeps is the head line's own repeats and the table's repeats of itself.

    AND ONLY A VERB'S TABLE IS KEPT CELL BY CELL.  lib/verbs reads a verb's
    table by what each cell is -- French inclus is the first person present
    AND the participle, finit the present AND the past historic -- and
    nothing reads an adjective's.  A German adjective fills a dozen cells
    with four spellings (freien is strong and weak, dative and genitive,
    singular and plural), and keeping every cell of it doubled German's
    adjective rows (+116% on 40 000 pages of the extract) for notes nobody
    is shown past the fourth.  A table that is not a verb's keeps its first
    cell per spelling, as it always did; its head line is kept whole.

    Each row carries its pronunciation where the source gives one -- French
    tables do, on 99.8% of conjugated verbs, and it is the only record of how
    `prends` or `aimons` is said.  A row with none borrows it from a row of
    the same spelling on the same page: `aime` the first person has no IPA in
    the source, `aime` the third has /ɛm/, and they are one word.

    unvowelled page write يقول and أريد, which matched no row at all: only
    the bare page title did, and it returned every homograph of it.  lookup
    takes the harakat off what it reads (the registry's `strip` range), so
    the bare spelling of each row is stored as a row of its own, same entry,
    note and romanisation.  And the case goes the way lookup takes it off:
    str.casefold() writes the small of Turkish İ as i + U+0307, so `İzmir`
    was stored as a spelling no folded text could ever be.

    NOT WHERE IT IS ONLY THE HEADWORD AGAIN.  `head` is the entry's own
    word, whose row (note '') is in `rows` and is folded like any other.  A
    noted row that folds to that same spelling -- the vowelled `canonical`
    row مَن, كَتَبَ, whose bare spelling is the page title -- would reach
    nothing the headword does not, and would hang its note on every lookup
    of the word: the panel said `من (canonical)`.
