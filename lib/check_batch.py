"""Check one annotated paragraph before it goes anywhere near assemble.py.

    python3 check_batch.py <para.json> [--book <dir-or-slug>] [--ch N]

ERRORs must be fixed; WARNs are judgement calls -- read each one and either fix
it or be able to say why it is right.  Exit status is the ERROR count.

The JSON is one paragraph:

  {"idx": 11, "ch": 3,
   "ann": {"sentences": [{"chunks": [{"fa":..., "tr":..., "voc":..., "en":...}]}]}}

`fa` is the chunk's text in the book's language (the key is named after
Persian, the toolbox's first language); a language with a reading (Japanese)
carries the chunk's kana under "kana" beside "tr".  A language with a word
layer (Japanese, Chinese) may carry the chunk's word line under "words"
(lib/wordline.py), and the line is checked by wordline.check and nothing
else: its refusals are errors, its doubts warnings, and a "words" that is
there and blank is an error -- a chunk without words has no key.  book.json's
"reorders": true (kanbun) is passed on, so the words are never compared with
a reading that reorders them.

Which book: --book, else $FRANK_BOOK, else the book the current directory is
in (books.find_book).  Which chapter: "ch" in the JSON, else --ch, else
$FRANK_CH, else 1.  Nothing about any one book is written into this file, so
it runs unchanged in a folder set up for a new edition.

What is checked depends on the book's language (docs/languages.md section 6):
sections 1 and 2 -- fidelity to the source, what LaTeX will accept, the empty
and the required fields -- run for every language, with the marks, the
digits and the word boundaries taken from the registry; sections 3 to 8 are
the Persian edition's own conventions (sukun, /ey/, /ow/, chashm, budan's
stem, the never-gloss list, verb heuristics written against Persian
morphology, the pointing sweep, the ezafe seams) and run only when the book
is Persian.  Arabic gets nothing Persian: its vowelled text is checked only
for the generic agreement that fa and tr both exist.

A BOOK STILL BEING WRITTEN says so: book.json carries "draft": true, which
lib/draft.py writes when it makes an edition out of nothing but its text --
every chunk a whole sentence, every gloss blank.  Such a book would fail this
checker on the day it was created, which would make the whole idea useless,
so a chunk with NOTHING written in it (no tr, no voc, no en, no kana) is a
NOTE there and not an error.  One field written makes it a chunk somebody is
working on, and every field its language requires is demanded again: a
translation with no transliteration beside it, in a language that wants one,
is exactly the half-done work this file exists to catch, and it stays an
error draft or no draft.  Without the flag nothing changes -- an unwritten
gloss is an error, as it has always been.  A draft of a language divided into
words gives each chunk its reading from its words (kana, or tr for Chinese:
lib/draft.py), and that reading, unchanged, is not counted as written.

In such a language the words are part of the annotation: a finished
paragraph in which not one chunk has a word line is a WARNING, answered by
running lib/fill_words.py --json on the paragraph and correcting what it
proposes.  A single chunk without words stays legal -- the analyzer may have
nothing to propose for it.

A note is neither an error nor a warning and counts towards neither: an error
must be fixed, a warning is a judgement call, and a note is the checker
saying what it did not check, and why.
