/* Parseh — a video's page in the mobile interface (docs/mobile.md, §4.2).

   The video player is a page the server writes for its video
   (youtube/lib/ytpages.py from player.html), and this is its mobile layer,
   loaded by lib/parseh.js the way a book reader's is: the sheet is
   lib/mobile.css (html.m-player), and this script does what a sheet cannot.

   THE PAGE IS THE SAME PAGE: the video, the transcript, the glosses and the
   cloud, looking a word up, the notes.  What the mobile mode takes away is
   everything that writes the video or administers it -- its details, the
   caption timings, the download, the dictionary setup, stop -- and what it
   adds is a header a thumb can use:
     - ⋯ opens the rest of the controls under the first line, a group to a
       line, each group with a line saying what it is (as the reader's does);
     - the Browser | Mobile switch, in the last group;
     - the recording's controls float at the foot of the screen: ↺, ⏯ and ↻
       with the speed chip -- lib/narrctl.js, which drives the video through
       the handle the player hands out (window.ParsehPlayer);
     - HELD SIDEWAYS the video goes to the left and the transcript to the
       right, with the divider between them draggable (the player's own #grip,
       which takes a finger as well as a mouse), and a ⛶ button puts the video
       on the whole screen with the playing line over it as subtitles -- which
       answer a tap with the gloss cloud, exactly as the transcript does (the
       owner's choices, 2026-09-22, the whole screen rebuilt 2026-09-23).
   A card is not made here and a chunk is not edited: those gestures are
   refused while the mode is mobile, as they are in a book. */

  /* ---- the whole screen, with the playing line over the video ----
     Sideways only (the owner's choice): upright a video on the whole screen
     is a strip of picture with nothing to read.

     THE FULL-SCREEN ELEMENT IS THE PAGE, AND PARSEH LAYS THE VIDEO OUT ITSELF.
     ⛶ used to ask the browser to enlarge #playerwrap, and that box holds
     YouTube's own cross-origin iframe: on Android the iframe takes the top
     layer, nothing of Parseh's is drawn over it, and the viewer was left with
     no subtitles and a bar saying how to get out that would not go away (the
     owner, on a real phone, 2026-09-23).  So the whole PAGE goes full screen
     -- document.documentElement -- and the layout over it is this toolbox's
     own (html.m-vfullon in lib/mobile.css): #playerwrap pinned over the page,
     the video centred on black, the line being said lying over its foot, and
     the dock still where the thumb left it.  Where a phone refuses the
     request, the pinned layout is all there is, which is the same picture
     with the browser's own bars still showing -- and the refusal is SAID, not
     swallowed, since a button that does nothing and explains nothing is the
     whole of what was wrong.

     THREE WAYS OUT, because nobody may be trapped inside a video: the ⛶ in
     the corner (which fades with the dock and comes back at a touch), the
     phone's back gesture (an entry is pushed on the way in, and popstate is
     the way out), and a tap on the black beside the picture. */

  /* ASKING THE BROWSER FOR THE SCREEN, AND WHEN NOT TO BOTHER (the owner's
     1 of 2026-09-23: "a black cloud appears at the bottom explaining how to
     exit full screen, that doesn't vanish unless one swipes on it").

     THAT CLOUD IS NOT OURS.  Parseh has no words anywhere about leaving the
     whole screen except the corner button's own label, and none of the three
     black things this overlay draws -- the matte, the ⛶, the subtitle pill
     -- says anything of the kind.  It is Android Chrome's own notice about
     the Fullscreen API, drawn by the browser over the page, and nothing here
     can remove it or change a word of it.  It does not appear on an iPhone
     for the plainest reason: `Element.requestFullscreen` does not exist
     there, the call below throws, and no full screen is ever entered -- yet
     the picture is the same, because the layout is drawn by our own
     `m-vfullon` and not by the browser (lib/mobile.css, and it says so).

     WHICH IS THE WAY OUT OF IT.  If the whole screen is ALREADY ours --
     the app installed, where the manifest asks for `display: fullscreen`
     and the system bars are gone before any video is opened -- then asking
     the browser for it again buys nothing at all and costs that cloud.  So
     we do not ask.  Where it is worth asking, in a browser tab with an
     address bar to be rid of, the cloud comes with it and is the browser's
     to draw; there the video says once, briefly, what it is and how to be
     rid of it, because a notice you must SWIPE to dismiss is not a thing
     anybody guesses.  Said only where it happens: Android, and a screen we
     really did ask for. */
