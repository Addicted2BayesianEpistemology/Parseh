/* Parseh — the little shared script: the theme, the language preference,
   the browser or mobile mode, a toast, the clipboard, the stop button.
   Served at /lib/parseh.js; loaded early in <head> so the theme (and the
   mode) is on the page before it paints.

   Theme: ONE preference for the whole toolbox, `parseh_theme` in
   localStorage, applied as data-theme on <html>.  The button cycles the
   three palettes -- light, dark, and the sepia paper the studio's reading
   sheet has always had.  'auto' is a fourth value, but not a step in the
   cycle: it is the state before anything has been picked, when no
   attribute is set and the stylesheet follows the system.  The button then
   shows whichever palette the system resolved to, so the first click always
   changes something.  The older per-tool keys (bk_theme, yt_theme) are read
   once as a migration and never written again. */
(function () {
  'use strict';

  /* THE PAGE ARRIVES ALREADY KNOWING THE COMPUTER IS AWAY (the owner's rule
     of 2026-09-23): "if the page knows the machine is offline when you click
     a thing, the page you arrive at should already know it is offline and
     act accordingly.  A book, a notebook, a deck of exercises does not
     change from offline to online mid-use."

     lib/mobile.py writes the same few lines (AWAY_BOOT) into the head of
     every page the server composes, before any script of that page's own.
     The two pages it does NOT compose are the two he named first: a BOOK'S
     READER, built by lib/tex2html.py, and a VIDEO'S PAGE -- and both of them
     load this file, in the head, ahead of everything else they run.  So it
     is set here too, for them.  Doing it twice costs one attribute write.

     It must be here at the very top and not in `appHead` below: appHead runs
     after the document is parsed, by which time a reader has already fired
     the lookup it makes on sight, and the whole point is to be earlier than
     that.  lib/keep.js reads this mark when it starts rather than assuming
     the computer is there, and may turn it ON later; it may not turn it off
     while the page is open once its own question has confirmed it.

     NOT ON A REFRESH (the owner's fall-back, 2026-09-24): "if we refresh the
     page, then it is forced to check again if the computer is online -- so
     upon refreshing, do not assume still offline."  A reload of any kind --
     F5, the browser's button, a finger pulling the page down, ↻ -- is
     reported as "reload", already here in the head; the older
     performance.navigation says the same where the newer entry is not there
     yet.  The memory is left as it is, and the mark says `assumed`: what the
     page before found, not what this one has. */

  /* AND AN ASK THAT CANNOT HANG, for the pages this file is the only shared
     script on -- a book's reader and a video's page.  Both of them ask the
     computer the moment they open (is there a dictionary?) and again at every
     tap on a word, with a bare `fetch`; and a bare fetch towards a computer
     on the far side of a tunnel that has gone never settles, because that
     socket is not refused, it is swallowed.  lib/sw.js cannot help: it
     answers GETs alone.  So a reader carried into a tunnel showed "looking
     it up…" in the cloud for ever, and one opened there never grew its
     dictionary button at all.

     NOT A TIMEOUT, A WATCH.  A dictionary on a big book can honestly take a
     while, and cutting it off after three seconds would break the feature to
     fix the phone.  So the ask is left alone and waits for the page's one
     question -- is the computer there? -- which lib/activity.js asks for the
     whole page.  A computer that is slow goes on being waited for, however
     long it takes: slow is online (TO-DO §2.24).  A computer the question
     finds GONE ends the ask at once with `away` set, which is what the
     callers show a sentence about instead of a spinner.  It used to ask that
     question itself, beside every ask, and read three seconds without an
     answer as "gone" -- which on a slow tunnel made the asks, and the
     probes beside them, pile up until a healthy computer looked absent. */

  /* ---- the mode: browser or mobile ----
     ONE switch for the whole toolbox, set from the hub's top bar.  In the
     browser mode every page is what it has always been, editing and all.
     The mobile mode is a second set of pages made to be READ on a phone --
     streamlined, and without a single editing control on them.  It is NOT
     the phone adjustments the pages already make (the bar that hides on a
     scroll, the layouts under 560px): those follow the width of the screen
     and go on doing so in either mode.  This follows a choice.

     Stored as `parseh_mode` in localStorage, 'browser' or 'mobile', where
     nothing stored means browser; and mirrored in a cookie of the same name,
     because the server and the studio's and the exercises' pages (which do
     not load this script) have to be able to read it too.  When storage
     holds nothing -- blocked, or never written on this origin -- the cookie
     answers.  It is put on <html> as data-mode as soon as this script is
     parsed, as the theme is, so a page's stylesheet has switched layouts
     before the first paint.

     A page that HAS a mobile version is listed in MOBILE_PAGES, and
     route(url) says where a link to url leads in the mode the toolbox is
     in: to the mobile version when there is one and the mode is mobile,
     and to url itself otherwise.  The browser page is always the fallback,
     so a page nobody has written a mobile version of yet simply opens as it
     is.  On a page that is itself a mobile page (<body data-mobile-page>)
     every link is routed that way.  Nothing is refused, in either mode: a
     browser page reached by its address works as it always has.  The design
     and the way to add a mobile page are in docs/mobile.md. */

     it and the thing is off the shelf the moment it lands -- and says where
     it went.  The question below says so too, because a person about to
     press a red button should be told what it does, not reassured.

     joins two words, ✂ cuts one where it is pointed at, and ← → on a word's
     text move where that word begins.  Under the chips is a textarea that
     always holds the line: the chips rewrite it, typing in it redraws the
     chips whenever it parses, and it is what the page sends -- as in the
     divide sheets, no offset crosses the wire.  Everything here counts code

     kana or tr, which check() only compares with the words; `propose` an
     async () => line or ''.  onchange(line, result) runs on every change a
     person makes, with check()'s {errors, warnings}; set() is the caller's

  /* ---- the bar, on a phone ----
     A phone screen is mostly bar: the reader's header wraps into three rows
     and what is left over is too little to read in.  So on a narrow screen
     the bar goes away as soon as the page moves down, and comes back on the
     smallest move up -- not only at the top of the page, which would mean
     scrolling a chapter back to reach one button.

     NOTHING CHANGES ON A WIDE SCREEN.  The listener is wired only while the
     media query matches, and the class it toggles is defined only inside
     the same query in every stylesheet that answers it.

     The class goes on <body> and each page's own sheet says what to do with
     it, because the bars differ: the hub-level `.parseh-bar` is in the flow
     (it is made sticky there first), while the reader's and the player's
     headers are fixed.  Both move by a transform and nothing else -- the
     reader writes its header's height into body's inline padding from a
     ResizeObserver, and the player hangs its video off --headh, so a bar
     that changed height instead would drag the page or the video with it.

     A STRONGER HAND CAN STAND THIS DOWN.  The book reader also lets the bar
     be put away by hand (chrome-off, the same class and the same idea as
     the studio's own bars button); while that holds, the header is already
     away, and this has nothing to add -- worse, if it went on toggling
     `barhidden` regardless, that could come back true however the reader
     last scrolled, and bringing the header back by hand would hand it
     straight off-screen again.  So it simply does not touch `barhidden`
     while chrome-off is set, and the page that sets it clears `barhidden`
     itself when the bar comes back, so that pressing the button is what
     decides, not the scroll.  A page can hold the bar where it is for a
     while the same way, with <body data-bars-held>: the reader's mobile
     layer does while its ⋯ controls are open -- and the dictionary's sheet
     holds it while it is up, with a class of its own (html.m-dsup, below).

     IN THE MOBILE MODE IT FOLLOWS THE SCROLL AT EVERY WIDTH.  A phone held
     sideways is wider than 560px and has the least height of all, and the
     mobile pages' sheet (lib/mobile.css) answers `barhidden` at any width in
     that mode; the browser pages' sheets still answer it only under 560px,
     so a browser page opened in the mobile mode is as it was. */

  /* ---- the dictionary's sheet, on a phone (TO-DO §4.18) ----
     The owner, 2026-09-24: an entry read inside the gloss cloud "requires
     scrolling inside the cloud and from mobile is basically unusable".  It
     was a scrolling box inside a scrolling page, in a floating card a few
     centimetres wide, over the very word it was about.  So on a phone the
     dictionary opens as a SHEET from the foot of the screen -- the look of
     "Keep on this phone" (.kp-back / .kp-sheet, lib/parseh.css), under
     names of its own (lib/mobile.css draws it) -- and the cloud keeps what
     it was always good at: the reading, the transliteration, the vocabulary
     and the meaning, beside the word.

     ONE SHEET FOR BOTH PAGES.  A book's reader (lib/mobilereader.js) and a
     video's page (youtube/lib/player.js) each draw the entry with their own
     `dictInto`, into a box they hand in here; this is only the sheet around
     it, and it lives in this file because this file is the one both pages
     -- and every reader however old -- already load, as they load the other
     pieces the two panels share (senseLabels, pairMarkup, above).

     What the sheet does, all of it asked for:
       - AS TALL AS THE ENTRY, up to 86% of the screen, and scrolled inside
         beyond that (the owner's 1: no peek) -- ALWAYS, whatever the page
         pins at its top (dsClear says why).  It grows as the lookup lands,
         which it does after the sheet is open.
       - ONE SCROLLER, its body, with overscroll-behavior:contain: a finger
         can tell it from the page, and it cannot pull the page to refresh.
       - THE WORD MARKED (m-dword) for as long as the sheet is up, and
         scrolled into the room between the header and the sheet wherever
         the page can put it there; where it cannot, the sheet covers it, and
         closing the sheet shows it again where it was.
       - SENSES NUMBERED, one to a line, each hit's part of speech a label
         (the owner's 2: the three senses the server sends, nothing folded).
       - THE LANGUAGE'S DIRECTION AND FACE on every run of it: the entry's
         rules in every reader are written `#cloud .dict ...` and mean
         nothing out here, so the sheet restates them (lib/mobile.css) --
         and the hit's headword, which never said its language, is given it.
       - DISMISSED AS A PHONE DISMISSES THINGS: a swipe down, a tap beside
         it, the back gesture, and ✕ and Escape for a keyboard.  Closing it
         leaves nothing open (the owner's 4): `onClose` closes the page's
         cloud too, and a video the cloud had paused goes on.
     Where it stands: over the page, its dialogs and the gloss cloud, and
     UNDER the toast, the ? bubble and the keep sheet, so "?" still says what
     a thing in it is (lib/explain.js, 430). */

     -- which is most books, on any shelf, for any feature.  But every reader,

     the header to a phone and keeps every writing door of the page shut
     (lib/mobilereader.js).  Both are loaded in either mode, because the mode
     can change while the page is open -- a switch made in another tab -- and
     neither does anything until the mode is mobile.
     A reader is known by its address, /books/<language>/<slug>/reader/ (or,
