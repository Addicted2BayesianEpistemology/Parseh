"""Where Parseh lives: ONE place that says it, so that the next move is one edit.

Every address Parseh writes for itself is built here -- the repository the
updates come from, the foot of every page exported from the studio, the icons
the phone app is installed with, the line a download introduces itself with --
and nothing else in the tree spells the organisation or the domain.  A move is
an edit of the three names below, and then

    python3 lib/release.py links

which asks every address what it answers (docs/releasing.md, "Where Parseh
lives").  tests/test_project.py pins the literal addresses: a move is a
decision, and that test is where it is written down.

STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY, AND NO OTHER PARSEH MODULE: the guide's compiler
(html-guide/engine) and the studio's own server import it with nothing else
around, as they import lib/author.py.  No version is written here either
(tests/test_version.py scans for one): `agent()` is handed it.

THE PERSON IS NOT THE PROJECT.  The author's own GitHub profile is
lib/author.py's, the GitHub link of the author line (the Licences page, About,
the README): a person's, who stays where he is when the project moves.  The
GitHub link at the foot of the hub, of the Settings hub and of the guide is the
PROJECT'S -- GITHUB_URL below, which the page that draws the foot hands to
lib/author.py (author.foot_links), as the exported pages' foot links it too.

THE ADDRESSES A PERSON IS GIVEN and THE ONES A MACHINE FETCHES are told apart
on purpose:

  * a person may be sent through a redirect, and is, by GitHub, from the old
    name of a repository to the new one;
  * a machine -- the update road, the icons Chrome's WebAPK server fetches --
    gets an address that answers `200` as written, because a redirect is one
    more place to fail, and where the failure is silent (the phone app's
    install button just vanishes) nobody learns of it.
