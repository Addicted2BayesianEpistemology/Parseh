"""What a thing is made of, as ADDRESSES: what a phone must keep to have it
when the computer cannot be reached (TO-DO §19.3).

    offline.book(book_dir, url_base)     a book: its reader, its text, its
                                         pictures, each recording, its notes
    offline.video(video_dir, vid)        a video: its page, the player's own
                                         sheet and script, its transcript and
                                         glosses, the film if there is one here,
                                         its notes
    offline.deck(folder, slug)           a deck: its pages, its exercises,
                                         their pictures and recordings
    offline.shared()                     what every page of the app needs:
                                         the sheets, the scripts, the fonts

One answer per thing, with a VERSION for the whole of it, so the phone can
keep exactly that and know when what it holds is old.  `lib/bundle.py` already
knows what a book or a video is made of -- this is the same knowledge said as
URLs rather than as files in a zip.

THREE LISTS, because the owner chose so.  `small` is the page, the text and
the pictures, which the phone renews by itself the next time it reaches the
computer; `media` is the heavy things -- a recording, a film -- each with its
size and what it covers, which are PICKED one by one when the thing is kept,
and which never renew themselves in silence (2026-09-22).  `notes` came
later (2026-09-23), when the owner asked that a kept book keep the notes
written into its seams: it is a half-record of its own -- `small` for the
note pages, their pictures and the seams' list, `shared` for what the studio
must lend the phone, `media` for the notes' own recordings, with a `count`,
an about-size and a `version` -- and the keep sheet draws the whole of it as
ONE TICK, because nobody wants to tick thirty-four notes one at a time and
nobody wants them kept without being asked either.

EVERY ENTRY IS ONE ADDRESS.  A record is read by the sheet, by the worker,
by the freeing sweep and by whatever is written next, and an entry that
stood for several addresses would have to be expanded correctly by all of
them.  The grouping belongs where the owner sees it: in lib/keep.js, which
draws one row and fetches every address behind it.

Nothing here reads a byte of a recording: a size is the file's size and a
version is a hash of names, sizes and modification times.  Asking what a
narrated book is made of must not cost what playing it costs.

AND EVERY SMALL FILE CARRIES ITS DIGEST (the owner's decision A, 2026-09-23).
A tick in "Change what is kept" used to mean only "this address is a key in
some cache", which is true of a half-written body and true of a 503 the phone
was handed while the tunnel was going down.  So an entry the phone can afford
to check carries `digest`, the SHA-256 of the very bytes the server will send,
and the phone tests the body against it; a recording, which WebCrypto cannot
digest without holding whole in memory, carries none and is tested by its
length instead.  HOW BIG IT IS decides that, as he asked -- with a far lower
ceiling for a recording or a film (`DIGEST_MAX_MEDIA`), since those are what
get large and since the phone has to read a body whole to hash it.  A ceiling
of eight megabytes for everything had thirty-two of one book's fifty
narrations hashed at every press; a ceiling of two for them has none.

AND WHAT THE COMPUTER MAKES UP AS IT ANSWERS can have neither, and says so by
carrying `"check": "here"` (see `_door`): the phone may test that it HAS that
answer and must test nothing about it.  A page rendered from a template, a
stylesheet written out of the language registry, two files joined under one
name, a list of exercises with the scheduler's own numbers riding along in it
-- none of them has a length this file can predict, and a length nobody can
predict must not be offered as one to check against: it would have the phone
call a perfectly good page broken and leave that row unticked for ever.
Where such an entry still carries a size, the size is what the owner is being
asked to spend and not a claim about the body.

# checking a 228 MB narration would mean holding 228 MB in a phone's memory at
# once to learn something its length already tells us well enough.  Eight

# rule backwards: thirty-two of the fifty recordings of `principles-
# environmental-engineering-sci` are under eight megabytes apiece, so the
# ceiling let 128.9 MB of his narration be hashed to answer one press of the
# keep sheet -- and the phone, whose ceiling is twelve megabytes, then read
# each of those recordings whole into its memory to check it.  A RECORDING IS
# A RECORDING WHATEVER IT WEIGHS, and so is a film: what they are tested by is
# their length, which costs a header.  The ceiling stays as the second net,
# for the page or the picture that turns out to be enormous.
# A RECORDING'S OWN CEILING, far lower than everything else's.  Exempting
# recordings outright read his decision one way -- "length for the big ones"
# -- and lost the other half of it: a 38 kB mp3 IS a small file, and the suite
# proved what that costs, flipping one byte in the middle of a kept recording
# without changing its length and watching the sheet call it whole (a length
# can never catch a corruption, only a truncation).  So the rule is the size,
# as he said, with a second ceiling for the things that get large: a recording
# or a film is hashed only while it is genuinely small, which spares the phone
# reading megabytes into memory to check one and spares this end the 128.9 MB

# THE NOTES TRAVEL WITH THEIR BOOK OR THEIR VIDEO (the owner, 2026-09-23:
# "the keep button in books and videos should also keep the notes rendered in
# bare page way").  Until today the records here never walked a `markdown/`
# folder at all, so a kept book kept its text and its recordings and left
# every note he had written behind.
#
# THE LIST IS GATHERED BY THE DOOR AND HANDED HERE, and that is a decision
# rather than an accident.  A note is a studio document: which notes there
# are, what each renders to, and whether that render holds an exercise are
# the studio's own knowledge (store.list_docs, htmlgen.render_document), and
# lib/ MUST NOT import the studio -- a book reader, a bundle and a launcher
# all lean on this directory and none of them has a studio to lean on.  The
# alternative was to teach this file the store's layout by hand, which is a
# second copy of somebody else's truth waiting to drift.  serve.py stands on
# both sides of that line, so serve.py looks; this file is handed
#
#     [{"id", "updated", "dir", "exercises": bool, "maths": bool}, ...]
#
# and does what it does everywhere else: turns it into addresses, weighs what
# is on the disk, and stamps it for the version.  `dir` is the note's own
# directory, so its source, its pictures and its recordings can be weighed
# here without a second word to the studio.

    not scattered through `media`, where thirty-four rows would bury the two
    narrations he came to the sheet for.  They are a GROUP: one row saying how
    many and about how much, carrying every address behind it.

    ABOUT how much, and the word is in the answer (`about`).  A kept note is
    its page, and a page is the same wrapper every time plus this note's own
    text: so the measure is the wrapper (_page_wrapper, ten kilobytes or so,
    which is most of what a note costs) and the `source.md` on the disk,
    which is the cheap honest measure of the text.  Weighing the render
    instead would mean rendering every note to answer a question about
    keeping, which is the one thing this file refuses to do -- asking what a
    thing is made of must not cost what reading it costs.  A note's pictures
    are weighed exactly, being files.

    A NOTE THAT HOLDS AN EXERCISE KEEPS ITS FULL STUDIO PAGE (decision 3).
    The bare page carries none of the studio's scripts, and an exercise
    without them is a box that cannot be answered, checked or copied; that is
    why page_note sends such a note to the document page at the desk, and away
    from the desk it must open exactly as it does there.  So its address in
    this group is the document page's, and the studio's own files go in
    `shared` -- once for the phone, never once per book.

    THE MARKS GO TOO (decision 2).  The reader draws a note's mark in the seam
    from `<mount>/api/marks` and from nothing else, so a kept note whose list
    stayed on the computer is a page nothing on the phone can reach.  It is a
    DOOR (lib/sw.js, isDoor): the computer is asked first and the kept copy
    stands behind it -- which is also what makes a note written AFTER the book

# WHAT AN EXERCISE'S PAGE REALLY ASKS FOR.  A deck's pictures and recordings
# used to be looked for with a regex over the exercise's MARKDOWN, matching a
# markdown link -- `](/…)` -- and no exercise in this toolbox has ever been
# written that way.  A picture is `![](name.png)` with the deck's own folder
# left off, a recording is an `audio:` line inside a `:::exercise` block, a
# clip carries a window after it; and they are all relative, so the regex's
# leading slash could not match even in principle.  Over the owner's
# ninety-eight-exercise deck it found nothing, every time, which is why not
# one of his recordings was ever kept (2026-09-23).
#
# SO THE RENDER IS ASKED INSTEAD.  The exercise is rendered exactly as the
# cram page renders it, and the addresses are read off the html -- src, href
# and the data-src a lazy picture uses.  It cannot go stale when somebody
# invents a seventh way of writing a picture into an exercise, because the
# question it asks is no longer "what might this markdown mean" but "what did
# this page ask the server for".
_ASKS_FOR = re.compile(r'(?:\bsrc|\bhref|\bdata-src|\bposter)="([^"]+)"', re.I)

# WHAT AN EXERCISE RENDERED TO, LAST TIME ANYBODY ASKED:
# (asset base, language, id) -> (its `updated` stamp, the JSON length of its
# html, the addresses that html carried, whether there is a formula in it).
#
# THE RENDER ITSELF IS NOT REMEMBERED, and that is the point of the three.
# Those three facts are the whole of what this file ever wanted from a render
# -- what the cram door's answer will weigh, which pictures and recordings to
# offer, and whether MathJax must travel -- and they are a few dozen bytes
# where the html of one exercise is two kilobytes.  A shelf of decks costs
# this memory almost nothing and a re-render costs the door its speed.
#
# WHY IT IS NEEDED AT ALL.  The __offline door is asked again a second and a
# half after every open of a kept deck (lib/keep.js), and rendering ninety-
# eight exercises to answer it is reading the deck to answer a question about
# keeping -- docs/mobile.md: "asking what a thing is made of must not cost
# what reading it costs".
#
# THE STAMP IS WHAT IT IS REMEMBERED AGAINST, exactly as a note's render is
# in serve.py's `notes_to_keep`: `updated` is what the store already stamps an
# edit by and what this record's own version is built from, so a stamp that
# has not moved is an exercise whose html cannot have moved either.  It rides
# in the VALUE and not in the key, so an exercise edited REPLACES its own
# entry rather than leaving yesterday's beside today's.  The LANGUAGE and the
# ASSET BASE do belong to the key, because neither is the item's: a deck's
# language changed at the desk, or the exercises answered under another
# mount, is a different html for the very same stamp.
#
# BOUNDED, AND OLDEST OUT FIRST, for serve.py's reasons: a process that runs
# for weeks must not grow a memory without end, an exercise edited replaces
# its own entry rather than adding one, and a hit -- the case that must stay
