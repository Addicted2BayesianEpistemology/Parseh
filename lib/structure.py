r"""A chapter's name, and the sections inside it -- written into the .tex.

Two structural marks, both optional, both kept in the book's own files rather
than in a sidecar beside them:

    \chapname{The Dam}      right after \chapopen{1}: what this chapter is
                            called.  A chapter without one is every chapter
                            written before names existed, and the PDF and the
                            reader both fall back to its number alone.

    \secmark{The Spillway}  on its own line BETWEEN two paragraphs: a section
                            opens at the paragraph that follows it.

WHY THE .TEX AND NOT A SIDECAR.  Every top-level .tex travels verbatim in a
bundle of the book -- lib/bundle.py's `_owned` ends "every .tex but
frankdraft.tex", and only the `% @par` timing comments are ever stripped from
one.  A new JSON file beside book.json would have to be named in bundle.SHAPE
or it is dropped on the way out AND on the way in; a mark written into the
chapter is carried by the rule that is already there.  So a book downloaded
and uploaded again keeps its sections, which is the whole point of putting
them where the text is.

WHAT A SECTION IS NOT.  It has no number of its own and it changes no other
number.  Paragraph numbers come from \parnum and from nothing else -- no tool
in this project counts lines, blank lines or \parend to derive one -- so a
mark inserted between two paragraphs cannot move any of them.  This file
proves that rather than trusting it: every write re-reads the file and
refuses unless every paragraph number, every subparagraph label and every
chunk is exactly what it was (`_proved`).

WHERE THE MARK MAY STAND.  Above \parstart, which is above \parnum, which is
above the `% @par` comment that carries a subparagraph's times.  A line put
BETWEEN `% @par` and its \begin{frank} would be flushed into the wrong slot
by tex2html.load_times and that subparagraph would silently lose its timings,
so this file inserts above \parstart and nowhere else.

A paragraph is named "<chapter>:<paragraph>", exactly as lib/reading.py names
one: the chapter number a chapter file carries in its NAME (ch1.tex and
ch1b.tex are both chapter 1), and the 1-based number of its \parnum.  The
number comes from texwrite.book_chapters, which is where that rule already
lives -- lib/tex2html.chapter_no, lib/verify_book.chapter_of and
texwrite._chapter_no are three readings of one rule and this is not a fourth.
