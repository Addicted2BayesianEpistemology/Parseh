"""The verb entry a dictionary hit can carry: `hit["vb"]`, a \\vb ready to use.

    import verbs
    verbs.attach(result, "it", "vado a casa", "en")     # lookup.look_up's answer, in place
    verbs.build("it", hit, "vado", "vado a casa", "en")  # one hit -> the entry, or None

    python3 lib/verbs/__init__.py it "vado a casa"       # what each hit would offer

WHAT IT IS FOR.  A dictionary hit for a verb used to be offered to the chunk
editor as a \\dw -- `\\dw{ساختن}{mi-sāzam} to make` -- which is the one thing
a vocabulary line is told never to do with a verb (docs/new-book-prompt.md,
rule 6: "Every verb gets a \\vb"), and which paired the lemma with the
inflected form's sound besides.  The forms a \\vb prints are exactly what a
learner cannot guess and a dictionary CAN say: Wiktionary's conjugation table
is already in dict/<code>.db, one form row per cell with the cell's name in
the note.  So a verb hit now comes back carrying its \\vb, built from those
rows, in every shape a reader might want it:

    hit["vb"] = {
      "tex":   "\\vb{andare}{}{vado}{}{andato}{}{to go (aux. \\pw{essere})}",
      "plain": "andare · pres. vado · p.p. andato · to go (aux. essere)",
      "here":  "vado (andare · pres. vado · p.p. andato · to go (aux. essere))",
      "line":  "pres. vado · p.p. andato · aux. essere",
      "lemma": "andare", "parts": [["andare", ""], ["vado", ""], ["andato", ""]],
      "labels": ["pres.", "p.p."], "extras": ["aux. essere"],
      "meaning": "to go", "reading": "", "notes": [],
      "complete": true, "missing": [], "compound": null}

`tex` goes into a book's vocabulary line; `plain` is the lemma's entry in a
video's, which is plain text, and `here` the same entry hung on the word the
chunk actually has, with that word's own sound where anything says it; `line`
is shown under the hit in the reading panel, and `notes` beside it -- hints
that are not missing (Arabic's other masdars).

`compound` IS THE VERB THAT IS MORE THAN ONE WORD, whole: Persian's فکر
کردن, Turkish's teşekkür etmek, Hindi's conjunct काम करना, French's
locution avoir peur -- the four languages whose file writes such a verb as a
\vb and a \bw, where German's aufstehen, English's give up, Chinese's 睡觉
and Japanese's 勉強する are each one entry already and need none of this.  The
hit is the light verb alone -- کردن, "to do" -- and the verb is the pair,
"to think"; so the entry is not that verb and a word beside it but ONE
entry for one verb, and `compound` is that entry, written both ways:

      "compound": {"name": "compound verb", "whole": "فکر کردن",
        "sound": "fekr kardan", "mean": "to think",
        "bw":    "\\bw{فکر}{fekr}{to think}",
        "tex":   "\\vb{کردن}{kardan}{کن}{kon}{کرد}{kard}{}\\bw{فکر}{fekr}{to think}",
        "plain": "فکر کردن fekr kardan to think (کردن kardan · pres. کن kon · past کرد kard)",
        "complete": true, "missing": []}

`tex` is the one entry a book writes -- the light verb's \vb, its meaning
empty, and the \bw for the carried word run straight onto it with nothing
between them, which is what makes it one entry and not two (docs/lang/fa.md,
tr.md, hi.md) -- and `bw` is that second half alone, for a book that already
has its own \vb to hang it on.  `plain` is the one line a video writes, the
compound said and glossed as a whole with the verb that conjugates in it
after (docs/lang/fa.md's `compounds as فکر کردن fekr kardan to think`).
`missing` NAMES the same thing in prose, and goes on naming it; a recipe
fills `compound` from what the source gave and leaves a piece empty where it
gave none, marking it `complete: false` -- nothing here guesses, here as
everywhere else.  `reading` is the kana a Japanese headword is read with,
which the video's shapes print after it and the book's never do.

    verbs.attach(result, "de", "und stand langsam", "en",
                 sentence="Der Schuster lächelte und stand langsam von seinem Stuhl auf.")

The sentence round the chunk, where the reader sends it (both do), goes to
the recipe as ctx.sentence: a German chunk can hold a verb whose prefix is
in the next one -- that chunk's `stand` is stehen alone, and aufstehen with
its sentence.

WHICH FORMS, AND WHAT ELSE, IS THE LANGUAGE'S BUSINESS and never this file's.
Persian wants the present stem, German the preterite and the auxiliary,
Arabic the masdar and the verb's form number, Japanese the class; Chinese
wants no \\vb at all except for two kinds of verb, and English none for a
modal.  Each language says so in a recipe, lib/verbs/<code>.py, a function
`recipe(ctx)` that reads the entry's rows and returns a Parts, or None for a
hit that is not a verb it can describe.  A language with no recipe offers no
\\vb -- the same way a language with no dictionary offers no lookup -- and a
hit without one is offered as the \\dw it always was.  What IS here is what
every language needs and none should write twice: finding the rows, the
meaning, taking out what LaTeX would read as an instruction, and writing the
four shapes from one description so that they cannot disagree.

NOTHING HERE GUESSES.  A recipe fills a slot from a row the source wrote or
leaves it empty and names it in `missing`; `complete` is false then and the
editor's button says what is left to fill.  A \\vb that looks finished and is
wrong costs more than one that says it is not finished.

# ------------------------------------------------------ what a recipe returns
# What a recipe says about one verb.  `parts` is three (form, sound) pairs --
# the forms the language's two \vb labels name, after the lemma -- and a pair
# whose form is blank is not printed at all (the preamble's \ifblank), which
# is how Chinese and a masdar-less Arabic verb leave one out.  `meaning` is
# None for "the core's", which is the first ranked sense, trimmed; a string
# replaces it.  `extras` are what the language adds after the meaning, in one
# parenthesis, and `extras_video` what it adds only in a video's plain line
# (Persian's colloquial present: videos are spoken Tehrani, books are not).
# `missing` names, in words a person reads, what the language needs and the
# data did not have.
#
# `notes` are hints that are NOT missing, and so could not go in `missing`,
# which both editors read as "this slot goes in blank": Arabic lists 2-7
# masdars for 1,122 of its 7,233 verbs and the right one depends on the
# sense (وَصَلَ "to arrive" lists صِلَة before وُصُول), so the slot is filled
# with the first and the rest are a note -- `masdar also: مَقَال maqāl` --
# shown beside the line and never printed in the \vb.  `reading` is how a
# headword is READ where its writing does not say, printed after form 1 in a
# video's line and never in a book's \vb, whose chunk has its kana line:
# docs/lang/ja.md's video verb is `書く かく kaku · stem 書き kaki · …`.
# A reading makes the plain line more than texparse's reading of `tex`, as
# `extras_video` already does; notes are in no shape at all.

    would make of the same \\vb, or one verb reads two ways in two readers.
    Its rule is a space between two runs unless the first ends in a space,
    an opening bracket or a slash or the second starts with a stop or a

    is not the reading of `tex`: it carries the video's own extras, which the
