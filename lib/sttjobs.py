"""The transcription job: one at a time, on this computer, for the add page.

    started = sttjobs.start(source, lang, model, processing)   # -> {"job": token, ...}
    sttjobs.audio(token, offset, pcm, last)     # a YouTube capture, in pieces
    sttjobs.marks(token, marks); sttjobs.wave(token, rate, peaks)
    sttjobs.status(token); sttjobs.cancel(token); sttjobs.result(token)

NO HTTP HERE.  serve.py's /youtube/api/transcribe/* routes read the request,
call these, and send what they return; a refusal is a `Refusal`, which
becomes `{"ok": false, "error": "<a sentence>", "code": "<slug>"}` with its
status (`call`).  Nothing that reaches a person is ever a traceback: the
worker's own goes to the server's log.

WHAT A JOB IS.  It belongs to no video.  The add page names a source
(a YouTube video, or a film on this computer) through the add flow's own
validators, and gets back a TOKEN made here (secrets.token_urlsafe): the one
capability every other route takes.  No route takes a path, a device, a
precision or a temporary file's name from anybody; the model is one of two
words, the processing one of three, the language one Whisper knows.

ONE AT A TIME (a second start is 409 `busy`).  A multi-gigabyte model is
never loaded twice, a YouTube capture is real time and holds the person's
tab, and the slot is given up the moment a job ends or is cancelled.

THE MODEL IS HELD FROM start() TO THE END (getstt.using), the whole capture
included, so that Settings refuses to take the model or the program away under a
recording that has an hour of a person's time in it -- and says why.

ANY DEVICE THE NETWORK DOOR LET IN MAY START ONE (the owner): a phone, a
tablet, another computer.  Nothing here asks where the caller is, and
nothing may assume it is the machine the server runs on -- a remote
computer's Chromium can capture a tab and POST its sound, and a film is
named by a path on the SERVER's disk whoever names it.  The bound is the one
slot (409 `busy`) and Cancel.

THE STATES: awaiting-audio (a YouTube job, before its first piece) ->
receiving -> queued -> preparing -> loading -> transcribing ->
checking-dictionary -> optional whisper-second-pass -> done (editable review);
a film starts at `queued`.  failed and cancelled end it.  A finished job's
answer is kept for KEEP seconds and forgotten after; a cancelled one is
forgotten AT ONCE (only its token is remembered, so a page that asks is told
"cancelled" and not "no such job"), and an abandoned one -- a capture that
stopped arriving -- is let go after IDLE.

THE CHILD.  lib/sttworker.py, run with Parseh's own Python and the speech
runtime on its PYTHONPATH, in a process group of its own, registered with
getstt.track and with this module's own list: `cancel`, a stopped server
(atexit) and PR_SET_PDEATHSIG / the worker's own look for its parent all end
it.  The worker speaks JSON lines; `_message` is where each one lands.

THE WAVEFORM.  A YouTube job's peaks are the browser's own, from the same
capture (`wave`); they are HELD (youtube/lib/wavefile.py) for the video's
creation to adopt.  A FILM GETS NO WAVEFORM WRITTEN (the owner): the player
draws a film's from the film itself, so the worker only listens.
