"""Prove every built paragraph still reproduces its source.

assemble.py checks fidelity per batch, against the annotation JSON.  For the
older batches that JSON is gone, so nothing was left that could re-check them.
This walks the built .tex instead: it groups the \\ch / \\chr / \\chp chunks (and
\\chw / \\chrw, which only add a word line) by
\\parnum, strips the language's marks (the harakat, for Persian and Arabic;
nothing for Japanese and Italian), and compares against source/paras/.

A book may keep a characters.tex or a chapters.tex beside its chapters, and
the glob is ch*.tex: such a file is named and skipped rather than checked,
because source/paras/ch<N>_p<NN>.txt is named after a chapter number the file
has not got (chapter_of).  It is a note, never a fault.

    python3 verify_book.py [--book <dir-or-slug>]

Which book: --book, else $FRANK_BOOK, else the book the current directory is
in, else the first book under books/ -- so it runs unchanged in a folder made
for a new edition.  Labels are read in any language's digits.
