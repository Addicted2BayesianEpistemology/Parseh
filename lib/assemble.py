"""Turn the annotator's JSON into LaTeX, refusing anything that does not
reproduce the source text exactly once the language's marks are taken back

The report goes to stderr and ends with ALL PARAGRAPHS CLEAN or N PROBLEMS;
the exit status is 0 only when clean.  The .tex is written either way, so a
problem can be looked at in what it produced, but a file written on
problems is not to be \\input: a chunk without its kana, say, would build a
pass 1 with no ruby over it.

Which book: --book, else $FRANK_BOOK, else the book the current directory is
in (books.find_book).  The book decides the language, and the language
decides what is stripped for the fidelity check, which digits the labels are
written in, and whether a chunk is a \\ch or -- for a language with a
reading, Japanese -- a \\chr{col}{fa}{kana}{tr}{voc}{en}, whose "kana" every
chunk must then carry.  The chapter label may be given in any language's
digits ("۱", "1"); it is written in the book's.

A chunk that carries a word line under "words" (Japanese, Chinese; lib/
wordline.py) is written \\chrw / \\chw, the same arguments with the line last.
wordline.check is the line's whole validation: what it refuses is a problem,
what it doubts is printed as a warning and counted nowhere.  A chunk of such
a language that arrives with no "words" at all is given lib/words.py's
proposal, where the analyzers are in the running Python: kept only when
check refuses nothing in it, and counted in one line of the report.  A blank
"words" is not filled -- it stays the problem it is.  Without the analyzers
the batch is written, and reported, exactly as it was before any was proposed.
