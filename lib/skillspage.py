"""Settings -> Skills for your chatbot (brief §9.5, a0.4.2): each skill Parseh can make for a chatbot that keeps
skills, its size, its version and its hash, a button that downloads it, and under them how to install it and use
it, tool by tool.

A SKILL IS MADE WHEN IT IS ASKED FOR, from the same parts as Parseh's own prompts (lib/skills.py), and kept nowhere:
the page shows what it would be now and the download builds the zip the moment it is pressed.  EVERY DEVICE LET IN
MAY READ AND DOWNLOAD (nothing here changes anything Parseh runs: there is no setting behind this door), and there
is NO INSTALL BUTTON: installing a skill is always the person's own step in the chatbot, whatever the tool.

THE STEPS BELOW ARE WHAT THE CHECKED FACTS SAY (2026-09-29, from each tool's own help pages) and nothing more; each
tool has a link to its own help, and nothing is fetched.  Where a fact is not known the page says that it is not.

<p class="why">Download the zip above, then do what your chatbot's own help says &mdash; here is what each tool says today,
with its help page. A chat opens the skill's files only when it needs them, so the many files cost nothing until a
request names one.</p>
%(tools)s

inside a folder: unzip it, and zip the folder's <i>contents</i>.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>Using it</h2>
<p class="why">Beside <b>copy the prompt</b>, wherever %(name)s hands a prompt out for a skill, is
<b>copy the request for the skill</b>: one line that names the skill and the language, the mode and what you ticked,
and then only the text to work on. Paste it in a chat where the skill is installed. In a chat where it is not, the line
itself tells the chatbot to say so, and <b>copy the prompt</b> is the way. If a request is for a newer %(name)s than the
skill you installed, the chat says so in one line: download the skill again here.</p>
<p class="why">A prompt of yours that is <i>added</i> to %(name)s&rsquo;s goes after the request's first line; one <i>in place
of</i> %(name)s&rsquo;s cannot travel in it, because the skill carries %(name)s&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
