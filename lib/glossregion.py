"""Gloss a region of a book or a video with an LLM: the prompt that asks for
it, and the answer put back, chunk by chunk, through the doors a hand uses.

serve.py wires the routes (<book>/reader/__region/prompt and /apply,
/youtube/api/region/prompt and /apply); these functions are the contract.  A
request that cannot be answered raises Refused (a 400) or NotFound (a 404),
in words worth showing.

WHAT A REGION IS.  In a book, a run of SENTENCES -- subparagraphs, one
\\parnum each -- named by the reader's book-wide chunk numbers (data-c, the
number __edit/chunk takes): `first` and `last` are widened to the whole
sentences they fall in, because a sentence is what an LLM glosses and what
the division is checked against.  In a video, a run of CAPTIONS by their
index in annotations.json -- every caption, plain ones included, the
numbering /youtube/api/edit uses; a plain caption goes into the prompt as
context and is never glossed.  A book paragraph that reading.json folds away
is left out of the prompt and never written, and the answer says how many.

THE TEXT SENT is the chunks as they stand: the .tex's own \\ch arguments, the
annotations.json chunks.  A paragraph marked free in reading.json, a caption
freed from its transcript, departs from source/paras/ or transcript.txt, and
the page shows the departed text -- so that is what the prompt sends, and
neither of those files is ever read here.

THE PAGE NEVER DECIDES WHAT IS PROTECTED.  Everything is worked out again
when the answer is applied, from the files as they are at that moment -- not
from the prompt, which may be an hour old and may have been pasted into a
chatbot that ignored half of it:

  * a chunk is WRITTEN when any of tr, voc, en, kana holds text, not counting
    a reading still exactly as wordline.seed proposed it from the chunk's
    word line (check_annotations.unwritten -- the one definition, asked of
    books and videos alike); it is COMPLETE when it is written and carries en,
    tr where the language requires_tr, kana where it has a reading -- and
    there a seeded reading counts as present;
  * per chunk (the default): a written chunk is kept whole, and whatever the
    answer says about it is listed in `kept`; an unglossed one takes the
    answer's kana, tr, voc and en;
  * per field: a written chunk keeps every field that holds text, and takes
    the answer's value only for a blank one;
  * re-gloss: every glossable chunk -- every one not plain, blank or
    written -- takes the answer's four fields (an omitted voc empties voc);
    a chunk that was blank counts as FILLED, one that was written as
    REPLACED.  Without `confirm` nothing is written when anything would
    be replaced: the answer says how many, and the page asks.

Only kana, tr, voc and en are ever written.  fa, words, col, free, note and
plain never are: a chunk whose fa does not match the page's (after the
language's normalisation -- NFC, its marks stripped, whitespace collapsed,
or dropped where the language has no word separator) is dropped; an answer
that changed one of the others is told so in `kept`.  An answer that divides
a sentence differently cannot land, because the division is a person's: the
chunks it re-divided are dropped, and the ones before and after the change,
which are still the page's own chunks, may land.

NEVER HALF A GLOSS.  A chunk the answer would leave written but incomplete
is dropped whole ("would leave it half glossed: missing tr").  Hand edits may
fill one box at a time; an LLM answer may not, because nobody is looking at
the chunk while it lands.  Every value is checked by the surface's own door
before anything is written -- the book's texwrite._value (the voc macros,
the TeX specials, the marks a tr may not carry, what is not text), the
video's check_annotations.check_chunk on the chunk as it would stand -- and
then written through that door, texwrite.edit_chunk or annwrite.edit_chunk,
one chunk at a time, only the fields that change.  A door that still refuses
puts its own words in `dropped`, and the rest land.
