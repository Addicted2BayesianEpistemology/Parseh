Structures
    Book -> Chapter -> Paragraph -> Sub (one `frank` environment) -> Chunk
`\\parnum{۳.۱}` labels a Sub: paragraph 3, subparagraph 1.  A Paragraph ends at
`\\parend`, a Chapter at `\\chapend`.

Every Chunk and Sub carries the book's language (a languages.Lang, default
Persian): what the bare pass strips, how a label's digits are read and how a
chunk splits into words are the language's business, not this file's.  The
chunk's text is Chunk.fa whatever the language -- the key is named after
Persian, the toolbox's first language, and kept because every tool and every
stored file uses it.
