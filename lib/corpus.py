"""Sentences somebody has already translated, for the chunk nobody has glossed.

THE DICTIONARY CANNOT CHOOSE.  It lists every sense a word can ever carry --
`شیر` is lion, faucet, tiger and milk -- and the one this sentence means is
exactly what it has no way to say.  A parallel corpus can, without anybody
guessing: here is that word in a whole sentence, and here is what a person
translated that sentence as.  The reader decides, which is the same
arrangement the dictionary panel already has, with better evidence in it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It is not a translation of the chunk in front of the
reader; it is somebody else's sentence that happens to share words with it.
That is why every match is shown with both sides and with the source named,
and why the panel calls it what it is.  Where nothing matches well enough,
nothing is shown -- an honest blank beats a confident irrelevance.

ONE FILE PER PAIR OF LANGUAGES, `corpus/<code>-<gloss>.db`, built by
lib/getcorpus.py from Tatoeba's own exports, downloaded once and kept
nowhere else.  A language with no corpus is read exactly as it is read
today, the way a language with no dictionary is: the panel simply does not
offer this.

THE MATCH IS WEIGHTED BY RARITY, which is the whole reason it works.  A
sentence sharing `و` (and) with the chunk shares nothing; a sentence sharing
`وطن` (homeland) shares the point.  So every word carries the weight of how
FEW sentences hold it -- plain inverse document frequency, counted at build
time over the corpus itself -- and a match made only of common words scores
below the floor and is not shown.
