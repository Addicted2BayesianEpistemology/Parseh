the numbers of the shapes of what it writes.

    version.lowered(installed, incoming)    the formats a move would take DOWN

ONE FILE, READ ONCE.  The version is the one line of VERSION at the root of
the tree, and this module is the only Python that opens it: the server's
Server header and its first line in the log, the studio's Server header, the
"software" a bundle is stamped with, the user agent every downloader sends and
the foot of the hub all ask `version.VERSION`.  It is a plain file and not a
constant written in here because a shell script has to read it too, and
install.sh may run before any Python exists on the machine (it fetches one): a
line is read with `cat` in a shell and with `for /f` in a .bat, where Python
source could only be picked at with a pattern.  And it is not CHANGELOG.md's
top heading, because a heading is prose, and an edit to prose must never change
what the running program calls itself.  The one more thing to bump is held to
the other two -- the tag and the changelog's top heading -- by the release
checks (lib/changelog.py reads the changelog), so it cannot be bumped wrong
without a machine saying so.

A tree with no VERSION, or a VERSION this module cannot read, is refused at
import, in words: every release carries the file beside this one, so its
absence means an install somebody took apart, and a Parseh that does not know
what it is must not stamp a guess into every bundle it writes.

THE SHAPE, AND THE ORDER.  A version is spelt as the tags and the changelog
spell it: a stage letter, then whole numbers joined by dots -- `a0.3.1`,
`a1.0`, one day `b1.0` or a plain `1.0`.  The rule the updater (TO-DO §13.16)
compares by, and the only one anything here may use:

  1. THE STAGE FIRST.  Every `a` (alpha) comes before every `b` (beta), and
     every `b` before a version with no letter at all.  The letter names a
     period of the project, not a pre-release of the numbers after it, so
     b0.1 is later than a0.9 -- which is NOT how PEP 440 reads `1.0a1`, and
     is exactly why the rule is written here rather than borrowed.
  2. THEN THE NUMBERS, one by one, AS NUMBERS: a0.3.10 is later than a0.3.9,
     which comparing the two strings would get backwards.
  3. A MISSING NUMBER IS A ZERO: a1.0 and a1.0.0 are one version.
  4. A REHEARSAL COMES BEFORE ITS VERSION.  `aX.Y.Z-rcN` -- a0.3.2-rc1 --
     is a release candidate: the name of a tag a release is rehearsed with
     on GitHub before its real tag is pushed (the owner, 2026-09-25;
     docs/releasing.md).  It sorts after every earlier version and before
     the version it rehearses, and the rehearsals among themselves by N:
     a0.3.1 < a0.3.2-rc1 < a0.3.2-rc2 < a0.3.2.  N counts from 1 and has no
     leading zero.  It is the name of a TAG, and of the zip and the manifest
     built from it, and of nothing else: VERSION and the changelog's
     headings name the version being made, a0.3.2, the whole time it is
     rehearsed -- a rehearsal is the same work, not a version of its own --
     so read() and lib/changelog.py refuse one.  An install made from a
     rehearsal's zip says so in its manifest, and a later update from it to
     the version itself goes forward.

Anything else -- a leading `v`, a number with a leading zero, any other word
after the numbers (`a0.3.2rc1`, `a0.3.2-beta`, `a0.3.2-rc0`) -- is refused by
parse(), so nothing ambiguous reaches a comparison.

THE DATA'S OWN NUMBERS ARE NOT THE VERSION.  What Parseh writes to the disk
has a shape, and a shape changes far less often than the software: a book
written by a0.2.0 is read by a0.3.1 exactly as it stands.  Each shape has its
own whole number, kept BESIDE THE CODE THAT WRITES IT -- the stamps written
into the files themselves ("parseh-bundle/1" and its four siblings), and a
plain number for every store written without a stamp (a book's book.json and
its narration's timings.json, a deck's schedule, a video's waveform.json, the
studio's documents, the Anki decks, the settings in config/, the databases
the optional tools build in dict/, corpus/ and components/ ...).  Every place
a person's things are kept has at least one (tests/test_version.py holds
that against lib/release.py's list of them).  FORMATS below names where each
one is kept; formats() gathers them into one dict, which the release manifest
(.parseh-release.json) carries; and the updater will not, unless the person
insists after being told what may not survive, move to a version whose number
for any of them is LOWER than the installed one's -- an older Parseh may not
read what a newer one wrote (lowered() says which).  A number is RAISED when
the shape changes so that the Parseh before it would read the new files wrong;
a field added that an older reader simply ignores is not such a change.

READ FROM THE SOURCE, NOT IMPORTED.  formats() parses each file with `ast` and
takes the constant's value, running nothing: serve.py is one of the files, and
importing it would load the whole server; and the release builder asks the
same question of a tree it has only unpacked, whose modules must not run in
the builder's process.  The price is that each constant is a plain literal
assigned at the top level of its file, which is what they all are.
