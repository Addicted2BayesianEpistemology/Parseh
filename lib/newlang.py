"""Add a language to the toolbox: the registry entry and the files around it.

A language is one row of the registry (lib/languages.json for Parseh's own,
config/languages.json for one added on this machine) plus the two files that row
implies -- lib/lang/<code>.tex, what the reading editions' preamble leaves to
the language, and docs/lang/<code>.md, the conventions every annotation
prompt carries -- plus the three directories its content lives in.  Six
things, and the way to get it wrong is to forget one: the entry went in, the
server started, the chips appeared, and the first book of the new language
died in lualatex days later because lib/lang/<code>.tex had never been
written.  Nothing warned, because nothing looked.

So this writes all six at once from the flags, and --check is the other
half: it walks the registry and says, per language, what is there and what
is not, so "did I forget something" has one answer and it takes a second.

    python3 lib/newlang.py                    what it needs, and the languages there are
    python3 lib/newlang.py --check            every entry validated, every file it needs present
    python3 lib/newlang.py ko --name Korean --native 한국어
    python3 lib/newlang.py ko --name Korean --native 한국어 --script other \\
        --chars '\\uAC00-\\uD7AF\\u1100-\\u11FF\\u3130-\\u318F' \\
        --font 'Noto Serif KR' --web-font NotoSerifKR.woff2
    python3 lib/newlang.py ko ... --shipped   the row into Parseh's own table instead
    python3 lib/newlang.py --migrate          a hand-added row of lib/ moved to config/

WHERE THE ROW GOES.  A language added on a machine is that machine's, and
its row is written to config/languages.json -- the registry's second half,
which lib/languages.py reads after Parseh's own table and which no update
touches -- because lib/languages.json ships with Parseh and an update
replaces it: the row used to be spliced in there, and the next version would
have taken it away while the .tex and the .md stayed.  Those two files are
still written to lib/lang/ and docs/lang/, where the rest of the toolbox
looks for them; a release's manifest does not list them, so an update leaves
them alone.  --shipped is the other case, a developer adding a language to
Parseh itself for everyone: the row goes into lib/languages.json, and its
code into that file's `_shipped`.

It asks for nothing it can derive.  The folder is the English name in lower
case, the tag is the folder, the babel name is the English name, the Anki
model ids are the next free pair, the passes follow from what the language
has (the reading alone after pass 1 where the chunks carry words; a bare
pass where there are marks to strip or a reading to take off; a last pass
where there is an alternate face or a vertical setting), and the labels
follow the script.  It derives nothing it should be told: the direction, the
script kind, the character ranges, the fonts, whether there is a reading,
whether the chunks carry words, whether the language is ever set vertically.
Those are the flags, and getting one wrong is not something a default can
rescue.

Validation is hard and the refusals are loud -- an existing code, a folder
already in use, a code that is not two or three letters, a `chars` range
that does not compile as a regex in Python AND as a JS RegExp source (the
same string is handed to both: lib/languages.py compiles it, player.js does
`new RegExp('[' + L.chars + ']')`), an Anki id already taken.  A font the
machine does not have is a WARNING and not a refusal: the entry may well be
written on one machine for another, and every font lookup in the toolbox
already falls back.

What it cannot write is the prose: the "How to read this" page of the
reading editions and the annotation conventions.  Those are the two
templates it fills, lib/lang/_template.tex and docs/lang/_template.md, and
the last thing it prints is the short list of what is still yours to do.
Nor does it write lib/verbs/<code>.py, the recipe that turns a dictionary's
verb into a \\vb -- that is the language's grammar, in code -- and until
somebody does, the new language's verbs are offered as \\dw; the same list
says so, and names the registry's `vb_video_bare`, which has no flag.

Standard library only, like everything the server imports.
