"""Start a book or a video from nothing: the text, cut up, every gloss blank.

    import draft
    draft.book_from_text(text, lang, title, gloss, ...)        -> a book's files
    draft.video_from_transcript(transcript, lang, gloss, ...)  -> a video's

Everything a learner reads in this toolbox has so far been written by asking
a model.  This is the other way in: a person who knows the language is handed
the text already divided, with the transliteration, the vocabulary and the
meaning left empty, and fills them in themselves -- in the reader, in the
player, or in the file itself, which is a file they can open in an editor and
find-and-replace through.

A draft declares two languages, and they are not one question: `lang` is what
the book or the video TEACHES, `gloss` is what its meanings will be WRITTEN
IN -- an Italian drafting an English reader glosses it in Italian.  The gloss
is written into book.json / video.json, and for a book into main.tex as
\\BookGloss beside \\BookLang, so that the preamble sets the gloss column in
the language it is actually in and hyphenates it by that language's rules.
Nothing said means English, which is what every draft made before the field
existed meant.

WHAT "EMPTY" MEANS, AND WHY IT STOPS WHERE IT DOES
--------------------------------------------------
The text is given.  The translation, the transliteration, the reading and the
vocabulary are not, and nothing here invents them.  Between those two lies
the division of the text, and it is three cuts, not one:

  * into PARAGRAPHS -- mechanical.  A blank line ends one; a text with no
    blank line in it is taken a line to a paragraph, which is how a pasted
    chapter usually arrives.  The book pipeline already keeps them one to a
    file (source/paras/chN_pNN.txt), and this writes exactly those files.
  * into SENTENCES -- mechanical, at the terminators of the script.  A
    sentence is a subparagraph, `\\parnum{p.s}` and one `frank` environment,
    which is what a sentence is everywhere else in the toolbox.
  * into CHUNKS -- EDITORIAL, and left undone.  Where a sentence breaks into
    phrases is the whole of the Frank method: it is the judgement the person
    doing this work is here to make, and a machine guessing at it would hand
    them somebody else's reading to undo before they could start their own.

So a draft is ONE CHUNK PER SENTENCE.  The author splits it by cutting one
`\\ch` line into several, or one chunk of a caption into several -- an
addition to a blank page, never an argument with a guess.  The mechanical two
cuts are safe to get wrong in a way the third is not: the fidelity checks
join the chunks back together and compare against the source, so a sentence
boundary in the wrong place still reproduces the text exactly, and moving it
is a local edit.

A LANGUAGE DIVIDED INTO WORDS -- Japanese and Chinese, the registry's
"words" -- gets one cut more in a book, and that one is proposed rather than
left undone: each chunk's word line, `山(やま) へ 柴刈り(しばかり) に 、`, cut
and read by lib/words.py (see _chunk_line).  It is a mechanical cut in the
sense above: the words must rejoin the chunk's text, so a boundary in the
wrong place is a local edit and never a lost character.  Its readings are a
dictionary's, and they sit in the word line.  The chunk's own reading --
kana where the language has one, tr (the pinyin) where it has not -- starts
as those readings run together (wordline.reading_from), so the two agree:
a proposal like the line it comes from, which the author corrects with it,
and which counts as nobody's writing while it still says exactly that
(wordline.seed).  Where the analyzers are not in the running Python nothing
is proposed, and the chunk is written as it always was.  A video's chunks get
their line and reading the same way, the line as the "words" key after "fa"
(see _blank_chunk).

A BLANK GLOSS IS LEGAL
----------------------
Nothing in a draft's gloss was written by a person: no meaning, no
vocabulary, and no transliteration or reading beyond the one a language
divided into words is proposed from its word line (above), which counts as
unwritten until somebody writes something else in the chunk.  Nothing needs
to say so: a chunk nobody has glossed yet is legal everywhere.
`check_batch.py` and `check_annotations.py` count it in a note, the reader
and the player show it and open it for editing, and the PDF sets it -- so a
drafted book or video is read, built and filled in from the first minute, in
the reader's chunk sheet or the player's form, a chunk at a time by hand or a
region at a time with an LLM.  What the checkers do call an error is a
HALF-written gloss -- a meaning with no transliteration beside it, in a
language that requires one -- and emptying every box of a chunk at once is
how a gloss is taken off again.  Nothing here writes a marker into
`book.json` or `video.json`: a drafted edition and a finished one are the
same kind of file, some of whose glosses are still blank.

WHAT IS REFUSED
---------------
Characters that are not text at all -- the control characters and the
unpaired surrogates -- in either door, because a caption reaches a page and a
file just as a paragraph does.  The reason is written out once, at
`lib/texwrite.py`'s `NOT_TEXT`, which refuses the same class at the other way
in: a control character is invisible, passes every check downstream because
it sits identically on both sides of them, and then breaks the reader, the
build and the wire at once.  The tab, the newline and the carriage return are
text; `paragraphs()` has already collapsed them to a space by the time a
book's text is judged.

TeX's own characters (\\ { } $ % & # _ ^ ~) in the text of a book.  They
cannot be escaped here: the reading editions measure fidelity by comparing
the second argument of each `\\ch` with the source paragraph character for
character (verify_book.py, check_batch.py), so a `\\%` in the .tex beside a
`%` in the source is a mismatch in every one of them.  The text is the
author's to fix, and this says which character and which paragraph.  Every
refusal from this module is a ValueError, so one `except ValueError` in a
route answers all of them.

    """A whole reading edition, drafted from the text of one chapter.

    `text` is the chapter as the author has it -- paragraphs separated by
    blank lines, or one to a line.  `lang` is a registry code (or a Lang) and
    `title` the title in that language.  `gloss` is the language the meanings
    will be written in -- a registry code or a prose one (languages.gloss),
    and English when nothing is said, which is what every edition here was
    glossed in before a book could say otherwise.  `slug` is the directory name;
    without one it is made from `title_latin` or `title`, and a title that
    leaves no ASCII behind is refused rather than filed under a made-up name.
    `chapter` numbers the chapter.  `into` makes a NEW book and refuses to
    touch one that is already there, so a second chapter is drafted by
    calling this without `into` and putting the three files it names for that
    chapter (chN.tex and its two source files) into the book by hand, with
    one more \\input line in main.tex -- which is where chapter order is
    written down and the only place it is.

    by its path inside the book's directory --

        book.json  main.tex  chN.tex

        source/src_chN.json             the list assemble.py indexes into

    With `into` (the books/ directory) the files are also written, to
