/* Parseh — the narration's controls: play, the recording moved back and on,
   and how fast it plays (TO-DO §4.15, §4.17; docs/mobile.md).

   WHY IT LIVES IN lib/.  A reader is a page built for its book
   (lib/tex2html.py), and a book built before today carries nothing of what
   was added today -- which is most books on any shelf.  lib/parseh.js loads
   this file into every reader, in BOTH modes, so every edition, however old,
   gains these controls and the cure below without being built again.

   WHAT IT PUTS ON THE PAGE
     - the mobile mode: a dock of floating buttons at the foot of the screen,
       ↺ in the left corner, ⏯ and ↻ in the right with the speed above them,
       where a thumb reaches them without shifting the grip.  They fade when
       nothing has been touched for a while and come back at full strength at
       a touch, so they never sit brightly over the text being read;
     - the browser mode: ↺ and ↻ either side of ▶ in the header, and
       Shift+← / Shift+→ for them (← and → keep walking subparagraphs);
     - both modes: the speed is a chip saying 1.5×, and a tap on it opens the
       row of speeds; holding ↺ or ↻ opens the row of seconds, which the
       Listening group under ⋯ also shows, since a hold cannot be seen.

   THE SPEED IS THE READER'S OWN <select id="speed">, always.  The chip sets
   that menu's value and lets the reader's own handler run, so nothing here
   needs to know what a reader does with the number (it sets the audio's rate
   and keeps it as bk_rate).  An old reader whose menu stops at 1.5 is handed
   the options it lacks.

   A VIDEO HAS NO SUCH MENU, AND ANSWERS A MOMENT LATER.  A book's <audio>
   takes a rate between two statements, so asking it back is asking the truth;
   YouTube's frame is a message away, and asking it back in the same breath
   still gets the rate from before the change -- which is how the chip came to
   paint one change behind on a video and nowhere else (the owner, on a real
   phone, 2026-09-23).  So a video's chosen speed is HELD here and painted at
   once, and put down again when the player itself says it is playing at it.
   A video also keeps a speed OF ITS OWN, vd_rate, and never the book's
   bk_rate: watching and listening are different habits, and the speed a book
   is read aloud at has nothing to say about the speed a video is watched at
   (the owner's choice, 2026-09-23).  It goes back the moment the player is
   there to take it, which is not when the page is drawn.

   AND THE SPEED NEVER CHANGES BY ITSELF.  Loading a recording -- which the
   reader does whenever the narration moves into a part kept in another file,
   and at the first play of a book whose recording is not the page's own src
   -- runs the media load algorithm, and that puts playbackRate back to
   defaultPlaybackRate, which is 1.  The sound went back to 1× while the
   control still said 1.5×, and the only way out was to move the control to
   1× and back again (the owner's report, 2026-09-22).  The cure is in two
   parts: defaultPlaybackRate is set with every rate, so the load has nothing
   to put back; and the rate is set again after every load, for a browser
   that reaches the same end by another road.  A rate that changes at any
   OTHER time is somebody meaning it -- the audio element has a speed in its
   own menu -- and then the chip follows the sound instead of fighting it. */
