WHY A LIST AT ALL.  A book's PDF takes minutes, a backup of a shelf of
narrated books is gigabytes, and every one of those used to be a request
that said nothing until it was over: the page that started it showed at
most a line of its own, and every other page -- the hub above all, where a
person goes to do the next thing -- showed nothing, so a restore still
running looked exactly like a restore that had died.  serve.py registers
each long request here before it reads the body (so the upload itself is
covered) and takes it off after the last byte of the answer is written (so
a download covers the packing AND the sending), and /__activity hands the
list to lib/activity.js, which draws it on every page.

ONE ENTRY, ONE SHAPE, wherever the work is: a request here, a book build
in lib/bookbuild.py's job table, the HTML guide's compile in
lib/guidebuild.py's, a dictionary being fetched in serve.py's.
The job tables keep their own state and are merged in by serve.py at the
moment of asking, in the shape entry() makes, so nothing is kept twice.

    id        this entry's name, unique while the server runs
    kind      build, upload, download, backup, restore, narration, install,
              compile, lookup -- what the page may draw beside it
    label     what is happening, in words: "Building the PDF of ..."
    started   when, in the server's seconds (time.time())
    done      bytes so far, or None where nothing is counted
    total     bytes in all, or None where it is not known
    stage     what it is doing inside that ("receiving", "sending", the
              build log's last line), or None
    page      the address of the page that started it, where the browser
              said (the Referer), so a list elsewhere can link back to it
    job       the token the starting page put on the request (?job=...),
              which is how that page knows this entry is its own and how
              a download started by a plain link knows when it is over

A FINISHED ENTRY STAYS KEEP SECONDS longer, under "finished" with `ok` and
`finished` added: a download packed in a second would otherwise come and go
between two polls, and the page that started it could not tell "not begun
yet" from "already over".  It is also what lets a page flash "done" for a
short job it would have missed.

Thread-safe: the server is a ThreadingTCPServer, and every request that
registers runs on a thread of its own.
