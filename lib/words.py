"""Cut a chunk's text into words, each with a proposed reading.

    words.available("zh")                  -> can this Python cut Chinese?

Japanese is cut by SudachiPy and Chinese by spacy-pkuseg, read by pypinyin;
lib/lang/<code>.words.json says how.  What comes back is a PROPOSAL -- the
cut and the readings a person corrects in the word strip -- and nothing more:
a machine's reading is a dictionary's, not the sentence's (私 comes back
わたくし, 很长 zhǎng).  Given the chunk's own reading -- its kana, or its
pinyin -- each word takes its stretch of that instead, wherever the cut can
be laid over it (the section on the chunk's own reading, below).

THE INVARIANT.  Every proposal rejoins its text: the surfaces are slices of
it, whitespace is never a word, and a proposal that fails lib/wordline.py's
reproduction check is thrown away and [] returned rather than written.

Where the analyzers are not installed in the running Python, every function
answers [] or "" and the caller writes no words: a chunk without a word line
is legal forever, and lib/segmenter.py says what is missing.

# own kana or pinyin, which somebody wrote for THIS sentence.  So a proposal
# for a chunk that already has its reading cuts that reading into one stretch
# per word and gives each word its own.  What holds the cut in place is what
# the words are written with: in Japanese the kana of a word (okurigana,
# particles, katakana), which the reading must spell at that very place; in
# Chinese the syllables, one to a character, a syllable never running across a
# space or an apostrophe.  Where several cuts fit, the one nearest the
# machine's own readings is taken.  Where none fits -- the reading is of
# another text, or spells a word some way the cut cannot follow -- the
# machine's readings stand, as they do for a chunk not yet read.  Only a word
# with a Han character is given a reading, as before.
