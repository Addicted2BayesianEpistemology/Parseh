"""Fetch a translation model that runs in the reader's own browser.

    python3 lib/getmt.py                 what is installed
    python3 lib/getmt.py fa en           Persian to English
    python3 lib/getmt.py --engine        just the engine, without a model

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.  It is a TRANSLATION model: one job, no
prompt, no endpoint, no key, no conversation, and the same answer every time
for the same sentence.  It is not a chat model and there is no server to talk
to -- the engine is WebAssembly and it runs inside the page, so a chunk being
translated never leaves the machine, and the toolbox gains no Python
dependency at all.

THE ENGINE is bergamot-translator, the same one Firefox's own translations
feature uses, under the MPL 2.0.  THE MODELS are Mozilla's, distributed
through the service Firefox itself fetches them from, and they are tiny:
around 20 MB for a language pair, against gigabytes for a general model.

NOTHING IS COMMITTED.  Engine and models are downloaded into `mt/`, which is
gitignored for the reason `dict/` is: somebody else's work, under somebody
else's licence, and megabytes of it.  A pair with no model installed is read
exactly as it is read today -- the button simply is not offered.

ONLY TO AND FROM ENGLISH.  Mozilla trains its pairs against English and not
against each other, so a book in Persian glossed in English has a model and
the same book glossed in Italian has none -- there is no fa-it model to
fetch, and `trainable()` below is what the page asks before it offers the
choice.

AND NOT ALWAYS UNDER THE CODE THE REGISTRY USES.  The service names Chinese
by its script -- `zh-Hans` for the simplified characters Parseh's `zh`
teaches, `zh-Hant` for the traditional ones -- so the code is translated on
the way out.  That is a fact about the service's spelling and not about the
language, which is why it lives here and not in the registry.
