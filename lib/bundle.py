Everything a learner reads here is written by hand, and a textarea in a
browser is not where a person renames a character through fifteen paragraphs
or lines a column of transliterations up in a spreadsheet.  This is the other
way round the loop: one file out, the same file back, with the toolbox
refusing anything it cannot vouch for.

WHAT A BUNDLE CARRIES -- the authored files, and nothing else:

    a book     book.json, every top-level .tex but frankdraft.tex, NOTES.md,
               source/** (the .txt and .json the pipeline writes there) and
               markdown/** (the notes written into its seams -- in every
               shape, because they are part of the content), plus as much of
               the narration as the shape below asks for
    a video    video.json, annotations.json, transcript.txt, parts/*.json,
               waveform.json where one was recorded, markdown/** (its notes)

plus, at the root of the zip, the manifest below.  The tree sits under one
directory named after the slug or the id, so unzipping gives back a folder
with a name on it instead of twenty loose files in ~/Downloads.

THE THREE SHAPES OF A BOOK, asked for with `audio` and recorded in the
manifest.  A narration is not two files.  It is the recording
(audio/audio.webm, 219 MB on the book this was written for), its transcript,
timings.json, review.json and review-corrections.json, review.html, the two
book.json fields that name the first two -- and a `% @par` comment line above
every subparagraph of every chapter, which is the one a person forgets,
because it lives INSIDE a file the bundle carries whatever is asked for and
is what the reader actually reads the times out of (tex2html's load_times).

    text     the reading edition alone, with nothing left pointing at a
             recording: no timings, no review, book.json's audio and
             transcript nulled, the `% @par` lines gone.  What comes out is a
             book that reads as one that never had a narration -- not one
             claiming a narration it has not got, which is what the single
             download used to hand back.
    linked   everything except the recording itself: the timings, the review,
             the comments and the two fields all kept, so dropping audio/
             back in gives the full book again, file for file.  For somebody
             who already has the recording, and the shape to keep as a
             working copy, being the only one that leaves nothing behind.
    full     all of it, audio/ included, STORED rather than deflated (_pack).

`linked` is the default, and it is also what a manifest with no shape in it
means -- which every bundle written before this door had shapes is.  Both for
one reason: it is the only shape that leaves nothing out, so a caller that
does not choose cannot silently drop somebody's alignment, and a bundle
written before today installs today exactly as it did then.

A BOOK WITH NO NARRATION has nothing to leave out, so the three are ONE
bundle: the same bytes, the same filename, and no shape written into the
manifest at all -- which is also what keeps such a book's bundle byte for
byte the one this door made before it had shapes.  The choice is not
pretended to have mattered.

A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE HAS NO SHAPE and is not offered one: its media is an
address and never a file here, and its timestamps sync its own transcript
rather than pointing at a file that could be missing.  It packs to the bytes
it always did.

A VIDEO THAT IS A FILE ON THIS MACHINE has the same two words a narration
has, and the opposite default: `full` carries the film beside the glosses and
is what the download button asks for, `text` leaves it behind for somebody
who only wants the words.  A book without its recording is still the book; a
video without its film is a transcript of something the person unpacking it
cannot watch.

WHAT IS LEFT OUT, and why -- main.pdf has all three reasons at once.  It is
DERIVED (main.tex and the chapters make it, so a bundle holding it would
carry the same text twice), it is LARGE (a megabyte here, and the narration
beside it is hundreds), and carried back in stale it would LIE: whoever
opened it, or reader/index.html, would be shown text the .tex no longer
says, which is the one failure this door exists to prevent.  The same goes
for main.aux/.log/.toc, reader/ and .build-key/.reader-key -- the keys are
how build.sh knows a book has changed (they hash the .tex and book.json), so
a bundle carrying yesterday's key would tell the builder there was nothing to
do.  An install leaves the old keys where they are, which is the other half
of that rule: they no longer match the new text, so the next ./build.sh
rebuilds.

review.html is left out of all three shapes, and for none of those reasons:
it is a PAGE.  Everything under books/ is served as a static file, so a
bundle able to carry an .html could put a script of its own same-origin with
the reader, and the allowlist below is what stops it.  The one already in a
book is left where it stands, the way the PDF is.

Leaving the rest out is also what makes an upload safe to serve.  Everything
under books/ and youtube/videos/ is fetchable as a static file (serve.py's
STATIC_PREFIXES), so what an upload may put there is an allowlist -- the text
the doors already read -- and never a blocklist.  A bundle cannot install a
page, a script or a font of its own.  A note's pictures are the one place
that rule had to be thought about twice: a note is a studio document and can
have figures, so markdown/ carries images -- but not .svg, which is a
document that can carry a script and would land in exactly the place this
paragraph is about.  An SVG figure stays on the machine it was drawn on.

THE MANIFEST, parseh-bundle.json, is what makes an upload safe to reason
about: without it a zip of a folder is a guess.  Its fields are written (and
each is explained) in _manifest_for(); `format` is the only one install
believes on the bundle's word alone -- everything else it re-derives from the
files and refuses when the two disagree.

INSTALLING refuses, always with a sentence naming what to do about it:

    * a zip that is not a Parseh bundle, or a bundle of a format this
      toolbox does not read
    * a name that is not a plain directory leaf, or an entry whose path
      escapes the destination (../../etc/passwd, /etc/passwd, a symlink);
      such a bundle is never described, only refused
    * a language code the registry does not know, or one the manifest and
      the JSON inside disagree about -- and the same for the gloss language,
      the one the meanings are WRITTEN in, which may be a language nobody
      here studies (Spanish) but not one nothing here can set at all
    * a book whose main file is missing, whose main.tex inputs a chapter the
      bundle does not carry, whose chapters do not parse, whose text no
      longer reproduces its own source paragraphs (verify_book.py's check),
      or one of whose word lines cannot be set (lib/wordline.py's check)
    * a video whose annotations do not pass check_annotations.py (a chunk
      half glossed is only noted: it is the middle of the work, which is
      when a video goes out and comes back)
    * a slug or an id already in the toolbox where this one would go, unless
      the caller passes replace -- and the answer then says what is being
      replaced
    * a slug or an id already in the toolbox SOMEWHERE ELSE -- under another
      language's folder, or directly under books/ -- which replace cannot
      reach and is therefore never offered for; the answer names the language
      the copy is filed under, since that is what says which directory to
      move, rename or delete

and it is atomic in the sense that matters: the bundle is unpacked into a
staging directory BESIDE the destination (so the move into place is a rename,
not a copy) and every check runs there.  Nothing that fails leaves anything
behind, and the destination is not touched until the tree in staging has
passed.  A replace frees the destination with one rename, moves the new tree
in with a second, and then carries across everything of the old directory's
that THIS bundle did not carry -- the built PDF, the reader, the build keys,
and whatever of the narration the shape left out -- so re-uploading a chapter
can never cost somebody a recording.  What a replace does overwrite is the
authored text, deliberately and only when asked; in this toolbox that text is
in git, which is where an undo comes from.

A SHAPE SAYS WHAT IS IN THE ZIP.  It never says what to destroy at the far
end, and install deletes no part of a narration, ever.  The case is a `text`
bundle uploaded over the book it came from, with replace: the recording, the
timings, the review and its page all stay, and book.json is pointed back at
the recording it still has, because a book.json nulled beside a 219 MB file
that is still there is not a state any door of this toolbox produces -- it
would be keeping the bytes and losing the narration.  The asymmetry is
deliberate and is the same one as above: the text is in git and the recording
is nowhere, so the shape a person picked in a download sheet last week must
not be able to delete it.  The one thing that does not come back is the
`% @par` comments, which are in the text the replace overwrote; the times
themselves are safe in timings.json and the answer names the one command that
writes them back.

The refusals are exceptions carrying the message a user should see:
BundleError for all of them, and Exists (a subclass) for the one an HTTP
route should answer 409 with and offer a "replace" box for, the way the add-a-
video page already does.
