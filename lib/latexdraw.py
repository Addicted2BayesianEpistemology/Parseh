"""Drawing a latex block: compiled on its own, kept, and explained when it
fails (TO-DO §8.39, a0.4.0).

ON ITS OWN (the owner, 2026-09-24, settled).  A block is compiled in a
`standalone` document of its own, under its theme's preamble
(lib/latexthemes.py) and its theme's compiler, and what comes out is a PDF
cropped to the drawing.  The screen shows an SVG made from that very PDF
(PyMuPDF, the glyphs as outlines, as the studio's PDF figures have always
been shown: store.ensure_pdf_twin), and paper includes the PDF itself -- so
the two show the same drawing by construction, and a package added for
chemistry can never move a `:::math` formula, which never comes here.

COMPILED ONCE, KEPT IN markdown/latex/ -- derived, in no release, rebuilt at
will (.gitignore, lib/release.py NEVER).  A drawing is found again by its
KEY, the hash of everything that decides what it looks like:

  * the block's own LaTeX;
  * the resolved theme -- its preamble as it now is and its compiler, never
    its name: renaming a theme redraws nothing, editing it redraws exactly
    the blocks that name it;
  * the TeX installation: the compiler's own version, and the packages
    installed or removed through Parseh (the owner, 2026-09-25), so that a
    TeX upgraded or a package added draws afresh;
  * RENDERER, this module's own number, raised when the way a block is drawn
    changes -- never the version of Parseh, which would redraw everything on
    every release and call every kept page "updated".

A stale picture nobody can explain is the worst thing this feature can do,
worse than a slow compile: if in doubt, it is in the key.

SAFELY.  A theme and a document may come from somebody else, so a compile
runs with no shell escape, may read and write only its own temporary folder
and TeX's own files (openin_any / openout_any = p), is stopped after the
time Settings allows (30 seconds unless changed), runs in a folder wiped
after every compile (Formulae's way), and is killed when the server stops.

A FAILURE IS SAID IN WORDS, beside the block, with the line of the block it
happened on where TeX says one -- and the log's own line under it for
whoever wants it.  A failure is remembered as long as its key stands, so a
package installed since, or a theme changed, draws it again.
