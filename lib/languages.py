The table itself is lib/languages.json, beside this file: names, folders,
scripts, digits, fonts, TeX names, passes, Anki note-type ids.  Nothing else
in the toolbox holds a list of languages; adding one means adding an entry
there (docs/languages.md says what each field does and what else a new
language needs).

    migrate()                                       # a hand-added row of lib/ moved there, once

The table has a second half, config/languages.json, for the languages a
person adds on their own machine (lib/newlang.py writes it): lib/languages.json
is Parseh's own and an update replaces it, so a row written into it would
vanish with the next version.  Both are read here, Parseh's first, and to
every tool the two are one registry.

The target-language text is stored under the key `fa` in every data format
(video chunks, Anki cards, the .tex chunks read by texparse) -- the name is
from the days the toolbox knew Persian alone, and it is kept because every
tool and every stored file uses it.  Read it as "the foreign text".  Its
opposite number, the meaning, is stored under `en` for the same historical
reason and is read as "the gloss": which language the gloss is actually
WRITTEN in is `gloss()` below, and it is a per-book, per-video choice.

Standard library only: this is imported by the server, which has nothing
else.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ the gloss
# A book or a video declares TWO languages: the one it TEACHES (`language`, a
# registry code) and the one its glosses are WRITTEN IN (`gloss`).  They are
# different questions -- an Italian learning English wants the meanings in
# Italian -- and the studio has asked them apart since it had a front matter
# (`target:` and `lang:`, docs/languages.md section 5).  This is that same
# answer, for the two doors that used to assume English.
#
# ABSENT MEANS ENGLISH.  Everything written before the field existed is
# glossed in English and says nothing, so no file has to be migrated and
# nothing that is in the toolbox today changes meaning.
DEFAULT_GLOSS = "en"

# A gloss language is PROSE, not a subject: somebody may gloss Persian in
# Spanish, and nobody studies Spanish here.  So what may be written in is the
# registry's languages PLUS the prose-only codes below -- the same set the
# studio accepts for `lang:`, because it is the same question at the other
# door and one document must not be sayable there and unsayable here.
#
# WHY THE TABLE IS HERE AND NOT READ OUT OF THE STUDIO'S COPY.  The studio's
# is `texgen._HYPHEN_PROSE`, and it answers the other half of the question --
# what TeX calls the patterns, and how few letters may be left on a line.
# Two things stop lib/ reading it.  It sits inside the studio, and importing
# it pulls the whole studio in behind it (the reason draft.slugify is written
# out a third time), and lib/ is what the server imports, so it may depend on
# nothing but the standard library and itself.
# And the dependency already runs the other way: texgen.py imports THIS file,
# and for a code the registry teaches its table holds None and takes the name
# from `tex.hyphen` -- so this is the end both doors can already reach, and
# the same deferral covers the codes when somebody comes to write it.
#
# A prose language cannot be a registry entry instead.  An entry there is a
# language somebody STUDIES: a folder under books/, a script, digits, fonts,
# passes, Anki note types, lib/lang/<code>.tex and docs/lang/<code>.md, every
# one of them checked by `newlang.py --check`.  Spanish has none of that and
# needs none -- it is a language the toolbox WRITES IN, not one it teaches --
# and inventing the rest of an entry to hold two strings would put a books/
# directory and a pair of Anki model ids in the way of a gloss.  Nothing here
# is a second list of the languages taught, either: a language the registry
# holds is not repeated below, and where a gloss code is one of them the
# registry names it, gives its direction and says what babel calls it.
# `_glosses()` takes the registry first and only then these, so a row here
# for a language that has since been TAUGHT is dead weight that says the
# opposite of this paragraph -- Spanish sat here until it became a language
# of its own, and was removed the day it did.
#
# Every row is left to right, and lib/frank-preamble.tex says so out loud:
# a gloss code the registry does not carry is taken there as Latin-script and
# LTR, because guessing otherwise would set a page backwards without a word.
# An RTL prose language added here is that file's business as well as this
# one's -- which is why the direction is a column and not an assumption.

# code -> (name, native name, what babel calls it, direction)
