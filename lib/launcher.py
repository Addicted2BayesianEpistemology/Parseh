"""What serve.bat runs on Windows: a setup wizard the first time, then the server.

    python lib/launcher.py            first time: the wizard; then start, and open the browser
    python lib/launcher.py 9000       ... on another port, this once
    python lib/launcher.py setup      the wizard again
    python lib/launcher.py stop       stop a running server (the stop button on any page does too)
    python lib/launcher.py status     is it running, and where
    python lib/launcher.py cert       a fresh certificate, e.g. after the addresses changed
    python lib/launcher.py readers    every book's reader and the library page, as ./build.sh --html
    --no-browser                      start without opening a browser window

On Linux and macOS ./serve.sh does this job -- the server in the background,
a log file, a pidfile -- and ./install.sh is the wizard's counterpart.  On
Windows there is no setsid and no terminal session to lose, so the server
simply runs in the console window this was started from: that window is the
log, and closing it, Ctrl-C, or the stop button on any page stops the server.
Nothing here is Windows-only in principle; it is just that serve.sh is the
better tool where it runs.

The wizard checks what install.sh checks -- a Python 3 (serve.bat found one),
the bundled web fonts (and a Japanese font on the machine when there is
Japanese content), openssl for the certificate, each book with its language,
its narration and alignment -- and the environment everything else needs, with
every package environment.yml lists (lib/runtime.py): it offers to make the
environment in this folder, or to add what an older one lacks, and carries on
in it.  It offers to install what winget can, builds the readers and the
library page the way ./build.sh --html does, compiles the HTML guide as
install.bat does, and makes the certificate.  Serving itself needs only the
standard library.

AN UPDATE FROM SETTINGS RUNS IN THIS WINDOW (lib/updater.py, TO-DO §13.16).
The server is started knowing that this window waits on it (PARSEH_LAUNCHER),
and when it stops to be updated it leaves with updater.LAUNCHER_EXIT: this
window then runs the update's helper -- its lines are this window's log like
everything else -- and starts the new version in the same window.  A new
version that does not come up is undone and the old one started again.  And
an update that did not finish (the power cut) is finished or undone first
thing, before this file imports anything else of Parseh's, as serve.py does.
