"""The mobile interface's pages that the server writes (docs/mobile.md).

    mobile.videos_page()    /m/videos/, the channels, as a phone reads them
    mobile.channel_page(s)  /m/videos/<channel>/, one channel's videos

    mobile.app_head()       the tags that make a page part of the app
    mobile.mode_switch()    the Browser | Mobile switch, for a page's bar

The mobile interface is a second set of pages made to be READ on a phone:
one column, targets a finger can hit, and nothing on them that edits.  Most
of them are a second layout of the page they stand for -- the hub, the
exercise decks, a book's reader -- and need nothing here.  The book library
is the exception: books/index.html is a static page (lib/make_index.py)
written when a book is built or put on the shelf, so a layout added to it
would reach nobody's library until the next build.  Its mobile version is a
page of its own instead, written on every request from the shelf itself,
and lib/parseh.js routes every link to /books/ there in the mobile mode.

WHAT THE SHELF SAYS.  What the browser library's card says about a book,
less everything that manages the shelf: no delete, no build, no bundle
coming in or going out.  A book whose reader has never been built has
nothing to open, and a phone cannot build it, so its card says so and is not
a link.  Everything that CAN be tapped goes to a reader, where the mobile
layer (lib/mobilereader.js) takes over.

THE SHELVES ARE PART OF THE APP SHELL (the owner's 1 and 2, 2026-09-23;
lib/offline.py, shell()).  Kept by the worker, they open with the computer
away -- so what they show is as old as the last time it was reached.  The one
block each page is built round therefore carries `data-shell-block`: when the
worker has read the page again and found it changed, lib/keep.js puts the
fresh block in place of the one the page opened with.  /m/kept/ carries no
such mark: its list is the phone's own and the computer knows nothing of it.

# PARSEH AS AN APP (docs/mobile.md).  A phone's browser installs a site as an
# app -- an icon on the home screen, opening on the whole screen with no
# address bar -- when the site describes itself (the manifest below, linked
# from every page by app_head()), has a service worker (lib/sw.js, served at
# /sw.js), and is served over https with a certificate the phone trusts
# (serve.py's authority, handed over by /m/install/).  The app is the MOBILE
# INTERFACE: it opens on the mobile hub, with the mode set to mobile.
ICONS = "/lib/icons/"
# WHERE THE MANIFEST NAMES THE ICONS, which is not where the pages fetch
# them.  Chrome does not build a phone's app itself: it sends the manifest
# to a Google server, and THAT server fetches the icon addresses in it and
# packs them into the app.  It is out on the internet; this Parseh is on a
# home network or a tailnet, where nothing outside can reach it -- so an
# icon named on this server is an icon that server cannot fetch, and the
# build fails with no reason given: the install button vanishes and
# chrome://webapks stays empty.  The icons are in the repository as well,
# so the project's GitHub Pages serves the same four files at an address
# anyone can reach, and the manifest names them there.  Nothing else moves:
# the pages, the apple-touch icon and what is kept on the phone all stay on
# this server.  Empty this to name them here again.

    cannot be reached.  That is the whole reason PUBLIC_ICONS exists -- and

# THE VIDEOS, as a phone reads them (TO-DO §4.2).  The browser index is one
# card per channel and the videos a tap inside it; this shelf used to be a
# flat list instead -- every video of every channel, under a heading per
# channel -- and on a phone that is a page you scroll past rather than one
# you choose from.  So it is the browser's shape now (the owner, 2026-09-23):
# ONE CARD PER CHANNEL, saying its name, how many videos it holds and how
# many of them are glossed to the end, and opening the channel page that has
# always been there at /m/videos/<slug>/.  A channel with videos in two
# languages is two cards, one under each language's heading, exactly as the
# browser's index does it -- which is also what makes the chip row honest: a
# card counts only the videos of the language it is filed under.
#
# Nothing here writes: no delete, no add, no bundle either way.  A video with
# no annotations at all has nothing to read and says so on its own card,
# inside the channel; every other card opens the player, where
# lib/mobileplayer.js takes over.
#
# AND WITH THE COMPUTER AWAY (the owner's 1 and 2, 2026-09-23).  This shelf
# is a shell page, kept by the worker, so it opens in airplane mode showing
# the channels the computer had when it was last reached -- but a channel
# PAGE is only on the phone if the app warmed it (lib/offline.py, shell()),
# and one added since the last warming is on nobody's phone at all.  A card
# whose page is not here must therefore look like one that cannot be opened,
# the way a book whose reader was never built already does: CHANNELS_JS asks
# the phone's own caches, address by address, and draws the rest as m-off.

    glossed to the end, the levels they are marked with.  "Fully glossed" has
    to mean no chunk left blank as well as every caption glossed, or a video
    whose chunks are still being filled in would be counted here as finished
    work.

    One tag is this shelf's own: a channel where NOTHING has been glossed
    opens on a page where every card says there is nothing to read, and it is
    better said on the outside than found on the inside.

    data-m-page is the address the card opens, said twice so that CHANNELS_JS

    THE NAME IS WHATEVER YOUTUBE CALLS THE CHANNEL, and that is Persian for
    one channel and Latin for the next -- "Daughter of Iran [Comprehensible
    Input]" is his, under the Persian heading.  So it is given dir="auto" and
    no lang: the browser reads the direction off the first real letter, and
    the bracket of that name stays at the end of it.  Forcing the language's
    direction on it instead threw the bracket to the wrong end of the line.

    And it is set in the language's READING face, not its display one, which
    is the same choice the browser index makes (lib/parseh.css, a.book.chan
    .chname uses --tl-font).  A book's title on the shelf is target text and
    earns the display face; a channel's name is the app's own chrome, and
    Persian's display face is Nastaliq, which carries a line and a half of
    leading with it and set two lines of a Latin channel name a thumb apart.
    The card says so in its own tokens rather than asking for a rule of its
    own: --tl-alt is what .m-btitle draws with, so on this card --tl-alt IS
    --tl-font, and --tl-alt-lh (the leading Nastaliq needs) is nobody's here.
