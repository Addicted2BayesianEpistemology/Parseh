"""The "add a book" page: three ways in, and only one of them on screen.

A book is not a paste-the-answer job.  It is days of work, paragraph by
paragraph.  There are three ways to begin one, and they need almost
disjoint facts -- which is why the page asks WHICH FIRST and then shows
that one alone:

  1. by hand, here.  A chapter is pasted and POSTed to /books/__empty,
     which drafts the whole book with the text divided and every gloss
     blank -- a chunk nobody has glossed yet is legal everywhere, so the
     book reads and builds from the first minute -- and the reader (which
     has its own editor, a chunk by hand or a region at a time with an
     LLM) is where it is filled in.  It needs the book's facts and a
     chapter, and none of the four fields the outside folder needs.

  2. onto a book already here.  POST <book>/__append, addressed by the
     book's own path so no slug ever travels in a body.  Its body is
     three keys -- text, how, chapter -- and NOT ONE of the identity
     fields: the language, the gloss and the title are the book's
     already, read from its book.json.  The text may be a file instead
     (a PDF with its pages, an epub, a text file), sent as the body and
     recovered by lib/sourcetext.py.  For a book an agent is making, or
     one it made and the person wants it to go on with, the text is
     handed to the AGENT as a part (lib/making.py add_part) instead.

  3. made by an agent, in place.  The book's facts and its original -- a
     file the person picks, uploaded, so no path is typed on the server --
     become a folder under books/ (lib/making.py), with the instructions
     the agent reads; the person opens that folder in whatever agent they
     use.  Parseh never starts an agent.  Nothing is copied and nothing is
     brought back: the agent works on the real tree, and the book is on
     the library from the first minute, marked being made, where its
     making panel watches it grow.  Every device let in may make the
     folder; only opening it is the computer's.

What used to be a single fifteen-field block above three mutually
exclusive actions, with the mapping stated only in prose, is now
structure: the ten identity fields are built ONCE, in #ident, and MOVED
(appendChild, never cloned -- a clone would fork the values, the
listeners and the saved draft) into whichever way needs them.  The
original file, its pages, the edition to learn from and the box about the
person's own books render in way 3 alone, inside a labelled box that says
so.

The instructions the agent reads are lib/making.py's, and the server
produces them: this file lays the page out and fills none of their
placeholders, so the text the page shows is the text the folder gets.
Everything the page needs to know about the toolbox (the built books with
their languages and sizes, for Learn from; the books already on the shelf
-- built or not, because a name is taken either way -- and every language
of the registry) is embedded as JSON.  The language select defaults to
the toolbox's shared preference (Parseh.lang, the chip rows' choice).

A book declares TWO languages: the one it teaches and the one its
glosses are WRITTEN in (docs/languages.md section 3).  The second select
is that, defaulting to English -- which is what every book in the
toolbox is glossed in, and what a book.json with no "gloss" means -- and
offering both the languages the toolbox teaches and the prose languages
it can only set.

    book's face and direction rather than the identity select's.  And the
