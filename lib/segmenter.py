Standard library only.  serve.py imports this at startup, and the server may
be running a Python that has none of the analyzers -- serve.sh falls back to
the machine's python3 when the ilya-frank environment is missing -- so this
answers without importing any of them; lib/words.py imports them, and only
when asked to cut.  Every answer names sys.executable, because "not
installed" means "not installed in the Python that is running".
