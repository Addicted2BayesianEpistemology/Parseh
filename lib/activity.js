/* Parseh — what the server is working on, shown on every page.
   Served at /lib/activity.js.  lib/parseh.js loads it on every page that
   has parseh.js (the hub, the two libraries, the book reader, the player,
   the add pages, the Reading help page, the Anki wizard, the clip tray), and the
   studio's and the exercises' templates carry a tag of their own, because
   they do not load parseh.js.  A studio run on its own has no /lib/ at
   all: the tag 404s and every page there works exactly as before.

   WHY.  Building a book's PDF takes minutes; a backup of a shelf of narrated
   books, or a film brought back in a bundle, is gigabytes going through one
   request.  None of that used to say anything outside the page that started
   it, and often not there either: a restore still running looked exactly
   like one that had died, and the hub -- where a person goes to do the next
   thing -- never knew.  The server keeps the list (lib/activity.py, merged
   with the book builds and the dictionary downloads by serve.py) and this
   draws it:

     * a pill in the bottom corner of every page -- a spinner, "Working:"
       and what, "+N more" -- which opens into the whole list, each with its
       time and, where the bytes are counted, how far it has got;
     * on the hub, a panel under the brand as well, one row a task;
     * a short "Done" when something this page saw running has finished.
       Errors are not said here: the page that started the work says them,
       in its own toast, with the server's own sentence.

   POLLED, every 1.5 s while anything runs (or this page has just started
   something) and every 5 s otherwise, and not at all while the tab is
   hidden -- it asks again the moment it is shown.

   AND THE SAME POLL IS THE PAGE'S ONE QUESTION "IS THE COMPUTER THERE?"
   (TO-DO §2.24): every other script that wants to know listens to this one
   rather than asking the server itself -- see "asking the server", below.

   THE PAGE THAT STARTS THE WORK SHOWS IT AT ONCE, before any poll:

     ParsehActivity.local(label)        -> handle: .end(ok), .progress(done,
                                           total), .job, .url(u)
     ParsehActivity.track(fn, label)    -> fn(handle)'s promise, the entry
                                           ended when it settles
     ParsehActivity.expect(label)       -> a handle that ends itself when
                                           the server's entry for .job ends
     ParsehActivity.download(url, label)   a download by location.href

   A handle's .url(u) puts ?job=<its token> on the request, and the server
   records the token on its entry: that is how the page knows the entry is
   its own (shown once, not twice), and how a DOWNLOAD STARTED BY A PLAIN
   LINK is followed at all.  The browser's own download manager keeps the
   download -- a fetch and a blob would hold a whole shelf in the tab's
   memory and hide the browser's progress -- so a click on such a link is
   answered here with "Preparing the download…" at once, the link is given
   a token for that one click, and the entry lives until the server's entry
   with that token has come and gone (or never came, after a while). */

  /* ---- asking the server, and whether it is there at all ---- */
  /* ONE QUESTION, ASKED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE (TO-DO §2.24, decided with the
     owner 2026-09-24).  `/__activity` used to be asked by three things at
     once -- this list, lib/keep.js's probe every twenty seconds, and every
     watched ask of lib/parseh.js and static/app.js every three -- and none of
     them ever cancelled an ask it had given up on.  A browser opens six
     connections to an HTTP/1.1 server, and an ask abandoned but not cancelled
     keeps its own: driven, six of them made the next ask of a computer that
     answers in 2 ms wait five seconds.  On a slow tunnel that was a loop --
     a slow answer, a probe beside it, the probe late, "away" -- and it
     declared a computer gone that was right there.  So the list and the
     question share this one poll, one ask at a time, and an ask given up on
     is cancelled.

     WHAT "AWAY" MEANS.  The owner: "Offline will mean drastic things
     usually, it's not a status that should change fast ... We should not
     talk of offline for simply having a slow connection."  So:

       an answer, however late      -> THERE.  Slow is online.
       three asks in a row that fail at once, two seconds apart
                                    -> AWAY, in about four seconds.  A socket
                                       refused, a name not found, no route:
                                       the network itself saying no.  Once is
                                       not enough, because Chrome fails
                                       whatever is in flight the moment a
                                       phone changes network.
       the browser says there is no network, and an ask fails
                                    -> AWAY, at once.
       three asks across 45 s, and not one answered
                                    -> AWAY.  Over Tailscale a computer
                                       switched off or asleep is SILENT, not
                                       refused -- and silence is also what a
                                       slow link looks like at first.  Only
                                       time tells the two apart.
       no answer 5 s after the quiet began
                                    -> SLOW, which is still online:
                                       lib/keep.js says "checking…".

     A failed fetch never says why -- one TypeError, one message, whatever
     happened -- so how soon it failed is the only instrument there is.  Time
     the page spends hidden is not silence: the ask out is dropped uncounted
     and asked again when the page is seen.  lib/sw.js leaves this address to
     the browser, so what arrives here is the network's own answer and not a
     worker's guess at one.

     Whoever wants the answer listens for `parseh:reach` on the document, or
     asks `ParsehActivity.reach()`: {state: unknown | there | slow | away,
     why, since, asks}.  An AWAY is said again at every ask that goes
     unanswered after it, so what is written down for the next page stays
     as recent as the silence it describes. */
