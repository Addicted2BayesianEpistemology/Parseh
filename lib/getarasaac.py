"""The ARASAAC pictograms, optional and local: a picture for a word, kept on
this computer (TO-DO §8.40, W9, a0.4.2).

    python3 lib/getarasaac.py                   what is installed
    python3 lib/getarasaac.py get en fr         the word lists of those languages, and every picture
    python3 lib/getarasaac.py get en --500      ...with the larger pictures (300 pixels is the default)
    python3 lib/getarasaac.py update            only what ARASAAC has added or changed since
    python3 lib/getarasaac.py remove [fr]       one language's word list, or the whole folder

WHAT THIS IS.  ARASAAC (the Aragonese Portal of Augmentative and Alternative
Communication) publishes some fourteen thousand pictograms -- a house, to eat,
nervous -- drawn by Sergio Palao for the Government of Aragon, each with the
words that name it in some forty languages.  Parseh keeps them in `arasaac/`
so that an exercise the studio asks a chatbot to write can carry a picture of
what it is about.  It is optional in every sense: nothing here is imported,
fetched or started until somebody presses *get it* on Settings -> Pictograms
(lib/arasaacpage.py), and a person who never asks for it has the toolbox they
had.

THE LICENCE IS NOT PARSEH'S TO WAIVE.  The pictograms are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0:
the author, the owner and ARASAAC are to be named, nothing made with them is
for commercial use, and what is shared is shared on the same licence.  The
terms are https://arasaac.org/terms-of-use; their two forms of the credit are
CREDIT below, written word for word into `arasaac/LICENSE-ARASAAC.txt` when a
download ends, shown on the page before anybody presses a button, and listed
on /licences/ (lib/notices.py).

TWO HOSTS, AND NOTHING ELSE.  The word lists come from `api.arasaac.org`
(`GET /v1/pictograms/all/<locale>`, no key) and the pictures from
`static.arasaac.org` (`/pictograms/<id>/<id>_<300|500>.png`).  Whoever presses
the button, nothing a client sends becomes a path or an address: a language is
one of the forty names ARASAAC's own API lists (LOCALES), a size is one of two
numbers, and an id is an integer out of the answer the API gave.

WHAT IT TAKES, AND HOW MUCH (MEASURED, 2026-10-02: MEASURED below).  Every
language's answer lists all 13,829 pictograms -- the same ids, with the
language's words where it has any -- at 5 to 8 MB of JSON, of which Parseh keeps
a part only (the words, and a few facts: 2.4 MB of Spanish's 8.2, 0.1 of Turkish's 5.2).  The pictures come
one at a time on one connection, 11 kB each at 300 pixels and 23 kB at 500
(a random 400 of the ids, both sizes): 159 MB and 321 MB for the lot.  A
person is told that before anything is fetched.

WHERE IT GOES.  `arasaac/` beside dict/, mt/ and stt/ -- git-ignored, kept by
every update, outside what a backup copies (lib/release.py CONTENT,
lib/updater.py PERSONAL):

    manifest.json            the shape (ARASAAC_FORMAT), the size the pictures are at, when
    pictograms.json          one record per pictogram: the facts that do not depend on a language
    index.<locale>.json      one language's words, trimmed to what Parseh reads
    pictograms/<id>.png      the pictures, all at the one size the manifest says
    LICENSE-ARASAAC.txt      the credit and the licence, written when a download ends

THE FILES ARE THE RECORD OF HOW FAR IT GOT.  A picture appears at its own name
by one rename, so a file there is a whole one; `pictograms.json` marks each
record whose picture has not been confirmed yet (`p`), and is written every
few hundred pictures and when the run stops, for whatever reason.  A download
that was stopped, killed or cut by a dropped line carries on from there with
nothing fetched twice, and an update is the same walk over the records whose
`lastUpdated` the new list moved.

AN UPDATE ASKS BEFORE IT FETCHES.  A picture that is here is asked for again
with `If-Modified-Since` -- its own modification time is the server's
`Last-Modified` of the file it holds -- and the server answers 304 for the
many whose record changed (a keyword was mended) without the picture changing.

GENTLE ON A HOST THAT IS NOT PARSEH'S.  One connection, one picture at a time,
a short pause between two, a User-Agent that names Parseh, the server's
`Retry-After` obeyed, and a wait that grows after an error.  Standard library
only, like the rest of lib/: this runs inside serve.py's threads and from the
command line alike.
