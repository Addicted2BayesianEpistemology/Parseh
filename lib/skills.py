"""Skills for the person's chatbot: the prompts Parseh hands out, written once, for a chat that can keep them.

    build(name)                  -> Skill: its files, version and hash, made NOW from the parts the prompts are made of
    catalog()                    -> what Settings draws: each skill, its size, its version and hash
    Skill.zip_bytes()            the zip a person uploads (built each time, stored nowhere, the same bytes for the same files)
    validate(skill)              [problems]: the rules of an Agent Skill, as the checked facts have them
    for_region / for_new_video / for_studio / for_exercises / for_book
                                 the SHORT REQUEST a page copies instead of the prompt: a header line and the data
    parse_header(line) / render_header(fields)   the grammar of that line
    read(skill_files, request)   what a reader of the skill makes of a request, from the files alone

A SKILL IS THE PROMPT, NOT A SECOND TEXT.  Everything a skill says of the job comes out of the SAME kit the prompts
come out of (lib/promptkit.py) -- the templates, the language files, the box catalogue of the studio -- and the only
words this file owns are the glue of each SKILL.md: how to read the header, which file to open, the staleness line.
Where the answer is the REQUEST'S (a book or a video, the mode, the boxes ticked, the language's facts) the kit is
told to leave it open (`promptkit.Open`): a block stays between `⟦if …⟧ … ⟦end …⟧` and a name stays `⟨name⟩`, and the
header says which.  Where it is the person's (the options, the language) the answer is a FILE of its own, already
resolved: the model never reads both variants of a rule and picks.  `read` does what the skill tells the model to
do, mechanically, from the files alone, and tests/test_skills.py holds its result to what the prompt road makes
for the same request: the one test the brief asks for.

WHY NO references/ PER PART FOR THE GLOSS SKILL (meaning.md, answer.md ...): what a part says depends on the language
(its names, its fields, its kind of script), so a part per language is a file per language either way; the file a
chat opens is then the whole instructions in one read, and the number of files stays far under what other tools take
of a skill (Perplexity's API 100, Microsoft's Cowork 100).
