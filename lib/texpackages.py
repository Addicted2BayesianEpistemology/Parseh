"""TeX packages got for the LaTeX drawings, from Settings (TO-DO §8.39, a0.4.0).

WHERE THEY GO (the owner, 2026-09-25).  Into a folder of Parseh's own,
texmf/, through tlmgr's user mode -- which works on a TeX Live installed by
its own installer and on one a Linux distribution packaged alike, where a
plain `tlmgr install` refuses ("running on Debian, switching to user mode!"),
and needs no administrator -- from the repository of the installed TeX
Live's own year (a TeX Live of an earlier year is served by the historic
archive: a repository newer than the installation is refused by tlmgr).
Every drawing is pointed at the folder (TEXMFAUXTREES, lib/latexdraw.py).
On Windows with MiKTeX, MiKTeX's own package manager, which puts a package
in MiKTeX's own tree.  Removing only ever touches what Parseh itself put
there -- never a package of the system's TeX, and so never what Parseh's
own PDFs need (install.sh --pdf's list).

texmf/ IS CONTENT, like dict/: an update keeps it, a release ships it empty,
a backup copies it (lib/release.py CONTENT, lib/updater.py PERSONAL).  What
is in it is listed in texmf/parseh-packages.json, with each package's size
and licence as TeX Live gave them: the rows of Settings -> LaTeX drawings
and /licences/ read that list, and so does a drawing's key (state()), so a
package installed or removed draws afresh.

Getting a package is a job like a dictionary's download (lib/lookuppage.py):
what it costs said before it starts, its progress, Stop.
