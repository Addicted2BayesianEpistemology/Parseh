WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY ONLY FOR ONE SCRIPT.  lib/lookup.py needs the form a
dictionary is keyed by, and that is not always the form on the page.  The
case this was written for is a dictionary keyed in the Roman of the
scholarly editions while the edition itself prints Devanagari -- which is
what Wiktionary does with the classical Indic languages, keeping the
meanings under the romanised lemma and leaving the Devanagari page as a
pointer at it.  Measured on the extract this was built against, the Roman
entries outnumbered the Devanagari ones six to one (9129 against 1473), so a
lookup without this missed six times out of seven.

It is safe to do here and it would not be safe for most scripts, because
Devanagari spelling of the classical Indic languages is PHONEMIC: one
letter, one sound, no silent letters, no ambiguity to resolve.  The
transliteration is a table walk and a rule about the inherent vowel, and the
answer is the same answer every edition prints.  Nothing of the kind is true
of, say, Arabic script, where the vowels are not written; there is no
function here for it and there should not be.

WHAT IT IS NOT FOR.  Not for showing a reader -- the transliteration a reader
sees is the one an annotator wrote, in the `tr` field, under the conventions
of docs/lang/<code>.md, which is a person's reading and not a table's.  This
is a lookup key and lives where lookup keys live.

WHO CALLS IT.  Whichever language asks, by setting `"fold": "deva-iast"` in
its lib/lang/<code>.lookup.json -- and no language shipped today does, so
this waits for the next one that is printed in Devanagari and looked up in
Roman.  HINDI takes the same walk and gets a defensible answer, but Hindi's
dictionary is in Devanagari already, so it does not ask.  It would in any
case be the wrong answer for Hindi, whose inherent vowel is very often not
pronounced (`कमल` is *kamal*, not *kamala*, docs/lang/hi.md) -- a rule this
does not know and deliberately does not guess at.

THE OTHER HALF IS FOR SHOWING, and is the dictionary's sound written the
way the edition writes one: `from_ipa` walks a pronunciation through the
language's table (lib/lang/<code>.ipa.json) or its own respelling (French,
`respell_fr`); `tidy_roman` puts a romanisation the source gives into the
edition's letters; `form_sound` chooses, among the rows that reached a word,
which of them says how THAT word is said.  None of it guesses: a language
with no ipa.json has no sound here, and says nothing rather than something
wrong.

    carry the inflected form -- میسازم is `mí-sâzam` -- which is exactly what
    a reader meeting that word needs, and exactly what a model asked to

    The conventions differ in two small ways and both are mechanical: the
    source marks stress with an acute and this edition marks none, and it
    writes long a as â where this edition writes ā.  The acute goes FIRST,

    A LETTER NO WORD OF THE EDITION BEGINS WITH (`roman.drop_initial`) goes
    last, at the start of the string and after every space: Wiktionary writes
    Arabic's hamza on every word that begins with a vowel -- أَرَى is `ʔarā`,
