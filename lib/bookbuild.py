"""A book built from a page -- its PDF and its reader -- as a job the page polls.

    bookbuild.start(book_dir, "pdf")    the PDF and the reader, as ./build.sh <folder>/<slug>
    bookbuild.start(book_dir, "html")   the reader alone, as ./build.sh --html <folder>/<slug>
    bookbuild.status(book_dir)          {"state", "what", "log", "started", "finished", "ok", "code"}

    python3 lib/bookbuild.py <book dir> [--html]    the same build, in Python, where there is no sh

WHY A JOB.  A book's PDF is lualatex over every pass of every chapter: a few
seconds for a two-paragraph example, three quarters of an hour for the Persian
edition of 2,500 pages.  No request can wait for that, so the card's build
button and the reader's start a job and poll it: `state` is "running",
"done" or "failed" ("idle" for a book nothing has built since the server
started), and `log` is the build's own output, its last lines kept.  One
build a book at a time; asking again while one runs answers with that one.

WHAT RUNS.  ./build.sh wherever there is a POSIX shell: its cache, its log
checks and its retry are the build, and nothing here copies them.  Windows
has no sh, so there the same steps run in Python (build() below): the
narration's timing comments restored, lualatex twice where the machine has
it, the reader, the library page -- without build.sh's cache, which only
ever saves time.  Either way the build runs in the ilya-frank environment
(lib/runtime.py), whose python3 has the packages the reader is built with.
