"""What this person has settled, kept by the toolbox rather than by a browser
(TO-DO §4.9).

Two things live here, both asked for so that a phone can go on where the
computer stopped:

  * **The reading place**, per book: which subparagraph was last read, said in
    words as well as by its number, with the time and the device that read it.
  * **The settings that follow a person**, for every book at once: how fast a
    narration plays (`bk_rate`), the pause between repetitions (`bk_gap`), how
    far ↺ and ↻ carry (`bk_skip`), whether a chapter's start waits for play
    (`bk_stopbnd`), whether the recording goes on into the next line
    (`bk_cont`, "keep going") -- the theme (`parseh_theme`) -- and the NAMES
    a person gave the levels of a book (`bk_lvl:<language>:<pass key>`, one
    key for each: `bk_lvl:fa:vocal`).

WHAT IS NOT HERE.  What is SHOWN stays with the device that shows it: which
levels are open, the size of the text, the margins.  A phone is not a
computer, and somebody reading in bed does not want the screen they set up at
a desk (the owner's choice, 2026-09-22).  What a level is CALLED is the
person's, though -- a name is a word they chose, not a way the screen is set
up -- and so it follows them (the owner's, 2026-10-06).

    config/prefs.json
    {"settings": {"bk_rate": {"v": "1.5", "at": 1758531600.0,
                              "by": "Linux computer · Firefox"}, ...},
     "places": {"/books/english/three-clocks/reader/":
                {"i": 12, "label": "2 · 1.1", "pct": 40,
                 "at": 1758531600.0, "by": "Android phone · Chrome"}}}

EVERY VALUE CARRIES THE MOMENT IT WAS SET, because two devices may both have
been away: for the settings the last change wins, plainly; for the reading
place nothing is overruled at all -- a device opens at its own place and is
ASKED whether to go to the other's, which is the one thing here a person
might disagree with.

The file is this machine's, and no book's: it is not in `lib/bundle.py`'s
allowlist, so a book downloaded and handed on carries the edition, not
somebody's progress through it.
