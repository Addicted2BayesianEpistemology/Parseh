> **This page is a demo.** It shows everything a studio note can contain, one feature per

> in its place: the editor shows the source of every example beside its preview.
>
> German is written in the same alphabet as English, so nothing on the page can tell a German
> word from an English one. **Every German word is therefore marked**: it stands in square
> brackets followed by `{tl}` (for *target language*), like [Guten Tag]{tl}. The **tl** button
> in the toolbar writes the mark around the selected text.

## Writing prose

### Emphasis and code

Two asterisks on each side make **bold** text, one on each side makes *italic* text, and a
backquote on each side makes `inline code`, which suits a file name or a key such as `title:`.
Bold works on German too: **[Achtung!]{tl}** = *look out!*

An equals sign after a German word, followed by a translation in italics, is a gloss:
[Guten Morgen]{tl} = *good morning*. The page greys the equals sign, and every gloss goes into
the document's glossary.

### Lists

Three things to learn with every German noun; a line indented by two spaces sits one level down:

- its article: [der]{tl}, [die]{tl} or [das]{tl}
- its plural, often with a change inside: [das Haus]{tl} → [die Häuser]{tl}
  - and sometimes with no change at all: [das Zimmer]{tl} → [die Zimmer]{tl}
- the capital letter it always starts with: [der Tisch]{tl}, [die Liebe]{tl}, [das Essen]{tl}

A numbered list starts each line with a number and a full stop; the page numbers it for you.

1. In a statement the conjugated verb comes second: [Heute gehe ich ins Kino.]{tl}
2. In a yes-or-no question it comes first: [Gehst du heute ins Kino?]{tl}
3. After [weil]{tl}, *because*, it goes to the very end: […, weil ich müde bin.]{tl}

When every item of a list starts with a bold label, the labels are set apart as terms:

- **Nominative** the subject: [der Hund]{tl} = *the dog*
- **Accusative** the direct object: [den Hund]{tl}
- **Dative** the indirect object: [dem Hund]{tl}
- **Genitive** the owner: [des Hundes]{tl}

### Arrows, wrong forms and line breaks

An arrow shows a change or a derivation: [gehen]{tl} → [ging]{tl} → [gegangen]{tl}. The arrow
button in the toolbar types it, and a hyphen and a greater-than sign make the same arrow:
[sehen]{tl} -> [sah]{tl} -> [gesehen]{tl}.

A cross straight before a form paints it red as a mistake, and a green tick marks the right
form; both have a button in the toolbar. ✗[der Mädchen]{tl} ✅ [das Mädchen]{tl}

Lines of the source join into one paragraph. The return-sign button in the toolbar forces a
break inside a paragraph, as in this week:⏎
[Montag: Deutschkurs]{tl}⏎
[Dienstag: Schwimmen]{tl}⏎
[Mittwoch: frei]{tl}

## German on the page

### Whole paragraphs and blocks

A paragraph that is one single mark becomes a German block, set in the German face:

[Im Sommer fahren wir jedes Jahr an die Ostsee. Das Wasser ist kalt, aber die Luft ist herrlich.]{tl}

A block may run over several lines: an opening square bracket on a line of its own, the text,
and the closing bracket with its braces on the last line. Each return sign keeps a line break.
Inside the braces, `bg=` tints the block with one of five backgrounds: `quote`, `sand`, `rose`,
`sage` or `lilac`. Here is a poem by Goethe (1780), tinted as a quotation:

[
Über allen Gipfeln⏎
Ist Ruh,⏎
In allen Wipfeln⏎
Spürest du⏎
Kaum einen Hauch;⏎
Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde.⏎
Warte nur, balde⏎
Ruhest du auch.
]{tl bg=quote}

And a short dialogue on sand:

[
A: Entschuldigung, wo ist der Bahnhof?⏎
B: Gehen Sie geradeaus und dann links.⏎
A: Vielen Dank!⏎
B: Gern geschehen.
]{tl bg=sand}

[Übung macht den Meister.]{tl bg=sage}

That proverb, on sage, means *practice makes perfect*.

### What German does not need

Some features of the studio exist for other scripts and do nothing in a German note:

- **Automatic German** A paragraph in Persian, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese or Chinese is recognised
  by its script alone. German shares its letters with English, so it is always marked.
- **Display lines** A paragraph of nothing but those scripts' letters and spaces becomes a
  large display line. German has none.
- **Other faces** Persian and Japanese have a second typeface for their blocks (`font=`). German
  has one face only.
- **Vertical text** Japanese and Chinese blocks can be set in columns (`vertical`); German
  cannot.
- **Readings** Japanese words carry a kana reading beside the pronunciation; German has no
  reading field.

### Pronunciation

A pronunciation can ride on the mark, after `translit:` inside the braces. Rest the pointer on a
word to see it: [ich]{translit:iç}, [das Buch]{translit:das bu:x}, [die Stadt]{translit:di: schtat}
against [der Staat]{translit:de:r schta:t}. On paper only the German is printed.

The respelling uses German letters in lower case: a colon after a vowel makes it long, an
apostrophe goes before the stressed syllable, `x` is the sound of [Bach]{tl} and `ç` the sound of
[ich]{tl}. A colour and a pronunciation can share the braces:
[die Bäckerei]{teal translit:di: bäke'rai} = *the bakery*.

### Colours

Five named colours can be put on any word: `crimson`, `indigo`, `teal`, `violet` and `amber`.
Colour-coding the genders is an old trick:
[der Löffel]{indigo} for masculine, [die Gabel]{crimson} for feminine, [das Messer]{teal} for
neuter, [die Teller]{violet} for the plural, and amber for the verb that waits at the end:
[Ich habe die Teller]{tl} [gespült]{amber}.

Any other colour is a hash sign and six hexadecimal digits inside the braces:
[das Holz]{#8A4F2A} = *wood*. Hovering a German word offers a palette that writes these marks.

## Dictionary entries

A heading whose parts are separated by vertical bars is a dictionary entry: the headword, its
pronunciation, its origin, and after an equals sign its meaning. The meaning is not shown under
the heading: it puts the headword, with that meaning, into the glossary.

## das Mädchen | das 'mä:tçen | from older [Mägdchen]{tl}, a diminutive of [die Magd]{tl}, *maid* | = *girl*

- **Gender** neuter, like every noun made with the diminutive ending [-chen]{tl}
- **Plural** unchanged: [die Mädchen]{tl} = *girls*
- **Example** [Das Mädchen liest ein Buch.]{tl} = *The girl is reading a book.*

With only two parts before the meaning, the heading has a headword and its pronunciation:

## die Straße | di: 'schtra:se | = *street*

- **Plural** [die Straßen]{tl}
- **In Switzerland** [die Strasse]{tl}, since Swiss spelling has no [ß]{tl}
- **Example** [Wir wohnen in einer ruhigen Straße.]{tl} = *We live on a quiet street.*

The headword may carry a colour, and its pronunciation may ride on its mark, leaving the second
part empty:

## [das Buch]{teal translit:das bu:x} | | Old High German *buoh* | = *book*

- **Plural** with an umlaut: [die Bücher]{translit:di: 'bü:ça}
- **Compound** [das Wörterbuch]{translit:das 'vörtabu:x} = *dictionary*, a book of words
- **Example** [Ich lese ein Buch.]{translit:iç 'le:ze ain bu:x} = *I am reading a book.*

## Tables

A table is a header row, a row of hyphens, and the body. Colons in the hyphen row align a
column to the left, the centre or the right, and a cell holding two hyphens stays empty.

| singular | plural | English |
|:---|:---:|---:|
| [der Tag]{tl} | [die Tage]{tl} | day |
| [das Buch]{tl} | [die Bücher]{tl} | book |
| [die Nacht]{tl} | [die Nächte]{tl} | night |
| -- | [die Eltern]{tl} | parents |
| [die Milch]{tl} | -- | milk |

## Footnotes

German writes every noun with a capital letter.[^1] A footnote is a caret and a name in square
brackets, and its text goes on a line of its own anywhere in the document, starting with the
same bracket and a colon.

German also has a letter all of its own, [ß]{tl}.^[Its name is [das Eszett]{tl}. Swiss
spelling does without it and writes [Strasse]{tl} for [Straße]{tl}.] A caret followed by the
text of the note in square brackets writes the note in place.

[^1]: Every word used as a noun takes one too: [das Essen]{tl}, [etwas Neues]{tl},
  [beim Schwimmen]{tl}. The polite [Sie]{tl} has a capital as well; the familiar [du]{tl} has none.

## Links

A link is its text in square brackets and the address in round brackets:
[a short film on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ).

A link can also point to another note by its title: [another note](doc:My second German note).
With the square brackets left empty it shows that title itself: [](doc:My second German note).
A link to a title that no note has yet is drawn as a dangling link; create a note with that
title and the link starts working. The **Doc link…** button lists the notes you already have.

## Blocks of English

A paragraph wrapped in square brackets and followed by `{la}` is a block of English set apart.
It exists for English inside a right-to-left or vertical document, where it keeps its own
direction. Anywhere, its lines can be centred, and the block tinted, narrowed and shifted like a
picture.

[**Tip.** Learn every noun with its article and its plural: not just [Tisch]{tl}, but [der Tisch, die Tische]{tl}.]{la align=center bg=sand width=80}

[This block is 80% of the column wide and pushed 10% to the right, the way a picture is placed.]{la width=80 offset=10}

## Mathematics

Formulas are written in LaTeX notation: [4 \times (3 + 1) = 16]{math} is the number of slots
in the table of the definite article, four cases times three genders and the plural.

Only six forms fill those sixteen slots: [der]{tl}, [die]{tl}, [das]{tl}, [den]{tl}, [dem]{tl}
and [des]{tl}. A formula on lines of its own goes between an opening line `:::math` and a
closing line `:::`, like this one.

:::math
\frac{\text{distinct forms}}{\text{slots}} = \frac{6}{4 \times (3 + 1)} = \frac{6}{16} = 37.5\,\%
:::

## Pictures, recordings and video

A picture is a line of its own: an exclamation mark, the caption in square brackets, the file
in round brackets, and the layout in braces (width and shift in percent of the column, and the
side it sits on). A caption cannot hold a square-bracket mark, so German there is in italics.

![An apple: *der Apfel*](images/starter-apple.svg){width=40 align=center}

![A house: *das Haus*](images/starter-house.svg){width=35 align=left offset=10}

A recording is written the same way, with its file under `audio/`.

![A short chime](audio/starter-chime.mp3){width=60 align=center}

`start=` and `end=` in the braces, in seconds or in minutes and seconds, play only a stretch of
it, here the chime's first note:

![The chime, its first note only](audio/starter-chime.mp3){width=50 align=center start=0 end=0.4}

A video starts with an at sign instead, and plays only the stretch between `start` and `end`:

@[A short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz-KE-bpKQ){width=70 align=center start=0:10 end=0:40}

The **Image**, **Audio** and **Video** buttons write these lines for you.
