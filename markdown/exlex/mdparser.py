"""mdparser — parse the exlex markdown dialect into a list of blocks.

The dialect is deliberately small; README.md documents it in full under
"The markdown dialect (authoritative)".
Block model: a list of dicts, each {'type': ..., **payload}.  All text
payloads are RAW markdown strings; inline conversion to TeX happens in
texgen.inline().  Keeping parse and TeX generation separate makes both
sides testable on their own.
