"""texgen — turn the mdparser block model into a complete .tex file.

The heart is inline(): it finds maximal runs of the target language,
freezes them as placeholders, LaTeX-escapes the Latin remainder, applies
the few inline markdown rules to the Latin only, then thaws the
placeholders as \\pe{...} (short, unbreakable) or \\pel{...} (long,
breakable).

Runs are treated as opaque: no markdown syntax is interpreted inside
them, which is what makes `*` (emphasis) and `*` (linguistics) coexist —
see README, "The markdown dialect (authoritative)".

Which language a document is about comes from its front matter
(`target:`, default Persian) and is held, like the footnote state, in a
thread-local set at the top of generate() -- set_target(); everything
that needs a regex for the script asks cur_lang() / run_re() /
has_script().  No regex for a script is written in this file: the
registry (lib/languages.json) owns them (docs/languages.md, 1 and 5).

    ONE SENTENCE OF THE TARGET LANGUAGE, WRITTEN AS ONE.  A blank is not
    target-language text: it is a hole in it, and the renderers cut the
    sentence at every hole and set the pieces themselves.  A mark cannot
    hold the hole, then -- but the author should not have to know that, and
    should not have to mark each piece by hand (which also loses the fact
    that the pieces are one sentence, and with it the direction the whole
    thing is laid out in).  So the mark is spread over the pieces here, once,
    where the exercise is parsed: every renderer downstream sees marks it
    already understands, and `is_target_line` reads the same text to say that
    the line as a whole is the target's.

    The mark's own attributes ride along (`{tl font=nastaliq}`), the marker
    word the author wrote is kept, and the spaces round each hole stay
    OUTSIDE the marks -- a mark is one laid-out box, and a space inside its
    brackets would be set in the target font and hang at the box's edge.
    Text with no slotted mark comes back unchanged, so this is safe to run
    over every field of every exercise.

# A LINK AS THE SOURCE HOLDS IT.  The renderers find a link only after they
# have put a target-language mark, a formula and a footnote out of the way
# (inline(): `[[il nome]{tl}](doc:X)` is `[\x05N\x05](doc:X)` by the time
# DOCLINK_RE looks), so its label may hold one of them -- the Doc link picker
# writes exactly that when the words selected are a mark.  Whatever reads
# the links of a RAW text -- a rename rewriting them, the migration, the
# "Linked from" drawer, the hover tools blanking the names -- must find the
# links the page shows, no more and no fewer, or a link on the page is one a
# rename leaves behind.  So find_doclinks reads the text as inline() does:
# those marks blanked first, in inline()'s order and by its own regexes, at
# the same length (every offset still points into the source), then
# DOCLINK_RE; and a footnote's text on its own after that, as a footnote is
# rendered on its own.
#
# A PIECE AT A TIME, as inline() is handed them: a paragraph, a list item
# with the indented lines that go on with it, a heading, a cell of a table,
# a footnote's definition -- never two at once, so no mark it finds reaches
# from one into the next, and neither may one found here.  Read whole, a
# long chapter cost seconds a call (MATH_RE looks for its `]{math}` from
# every `[` of the text, to the end of the text when there is none, and does
# so again from the next one), and every rename, every new document and
# every "Linked from" read all of them; and a formula's `]{math}` found
# further on blanked the links in between, which the page shows.  Cut at
# blank lines only, a glossary of a thousand items or a table of a thousand
# rows, which has none, was still one piece: a second a call, and a formula
# in its last item hid the links of all the others.  So _doclink_pieces cuts
# the text where mdparser cuts it, reading its lines in the parser's order
# as notes.excerpt does; an exercise and a `:::math` formula, whose lines
# are joined in ways of their own, are cut at blank lines only, as they
# always were.  A piece that does not say "doc:" holds no link, and is not
# read at all; and MATH_RE, which cannot match without a `]{math}`, is not

% it does not fit on this one -- but a box taller than the page is cut off
% at its foot, words and all: at 20 pt a reading passage and its questions,
% at 11 pt a matching exercise of ten pictures, each in its frame.  Such an
% exercise starts a page and goes on over as many as it needs, in one frame
% a page: the box is split between two of its lines.  One that fits a page
% is framed as it always was, in a minipage, and these are the lines that
% minipage would have set: the same box, in the same place.
%
% Straight after a heading it is not free to start a page: nothing may
% part a heading from what follows it, so the heading went with it.  A new
% page before it left the heading alone at the foot of the one before; and
% a box that fits a page, but not with the heading above it, ran off the
% foot of the page they went to together.  After a heading, an exercise
% that does not fit what is left of the page, and that a page might not
% hold together with its heading (five lines are left for one), starts
% right under the heading, in a piece as tall as the page has room for;
% when the page has room for less than three lines, the heading goes over
% with a first piece that leaves it those five lines.  A box inside
% another (a quotation) is never split: there is no page to measure.

CARD_PAPER = r"""% ----------------------- FLASHCARDS ON PAPER ----------------------
% A flashcard is printed as a card to cut out and fold: a frame with round
% corners -- the scissors on it say it is cut along -- its front in the left
% half and its back in the right, and a dashed line exactly between them to
% fold it on.  Folded, the two halves are back to back, a card in the hand,
% both faces the right way up.  Each half holds its side as the page's card
% draws it, in the middle of the half (texgen._card_sides); the card is as
% tall as its taller side, and never less than three fifths of a half's
% width, the shape of an index card.  The label and the prompt stand above
% the frame and never part from it, and a card is never split between two
% pages, which could not be folded: one taller than a page is made smaller,
% until it fits one.
%
% The frame is drawn by TikZ; a TeX without it (no pgf) draws a square one.
