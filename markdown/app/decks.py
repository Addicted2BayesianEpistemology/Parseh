"""decks — the exercise decks: studio exercises studied like Anki cards.

Stdlib plus the studio's own modules, and no HTTP (deckroutes.py is the web
side).  A deck is a directory of small JSON files, one per exercise and one
per exercise's schedule, so a crash mid-write can lose at most the answer
being written and a deck can be read and repaired by hand:

    exercises/<language folder>/<deck slug>/
        deck.json            {"format", "id", "name", "lang", "created",
                              "updated", "settings": only what differs}
        items/<id>.json      {"id", "created", "updated", "markdown",
                              "footnotes", "origin"}
        schedule/<id>.json   {"state": srs state, "history": [...]}
                             (missing: the exercise is new)
        images/<name>        flashcard pictures, a PDF's .pdf.svg twin
        audio/<name>         recordings (lower case, audiofile.NAME_RE)
    exercises/.trash/<folder>--<slug>--<stamp>/   deleted or replaced decks

Every exercise is one `:::exercise` block in the deck's language, checked
by the same parser the studio renders with.  The pictures and recordings it
shows are the files its markdown and footnotes name (_media_refs), wherever
they are named.  A deck travels as a zip (export_zip / import_zip), with or
without its scheduling.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- checked out
# STUDYING OFFLINE IS A CHECK-OUT (TO-DO §19.10, the owner's choice of
# 2026-09-22).  A phone that wants to study a deck on a train TAKES IT OUT:
# the deck goes with it, and the computer will not study or edit that deck
# until it comes back.  Nothing is merged and nothing can be lost to a
# conflict, because while it is out there is only one place it is answered.
#
#   * the phone sends every answer as soon as it can reach the computer, but
#     KEEPS THE DECK until "Give it back" -- so it can be studied day after
#     day away from the desk without checking it out again;
#   * the computer may still CRAM it: cramming never schedules (§18);
#   * "Take it back" is for a phone that will not come back (lost, broken,
#     left behind).  After it, that phone's answers are REFUSED and LISTED
#     rather than applied -- the owner chose that: once taken back, the
#     computer is the only truth, and nothing is applied behind the learner's
#     back.  Nothing is dropped in silence either: what was refused is kept
#     here and shown on the deck's page.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO JAVASCRIPT SCHEDULER.  The alternative that queued answers
# without ownership (§19.10 b) needed a port of srs.py on the phone, held
# equal to the Python by shared cases.  A check-out does not: the phone is
# handed the whole queue RENDERED, with the four interval labels the computer
# worked out (srs.preview, through /next), and every answer is replayed here,
# in the order it was given, through the very scheduler the computer always
# used.  One scheduler, no drift.

        link again tomorrow; an export drops it on purpose and a backup
        that did would quietly destroy it.
      * the scheduling always travels.  Months of answers cannot be worked
        out again from anything, and a backup that resets them is not one.

    A deck already on the shelf is KEPT and named in the answer unless

    folder, which is what a deck IS; a deck restored under a slug somebody
    has since given to another deck simply takes a free one.
