`<folder>` is the target language's folder from the registry (persian,
japanese, ...): a document is filed by its front matter's `target:` and
moved when a save changes it (docs/languages.md, 2 and 5).  A document
directly under library/ is from before languages were declared: it is
still read, as Persian, and reported once with a note to move it.

Ids are slug-of-title plus a random suffix, safe for URLs and paths, and
unique across the folders (the suffix is random, and _doc_dir looks
through every folder).

    stands, and which lines are drawn as no words at all: a front-matter
    key that is not a title, a `#` heading that does not become the

# images/ and no audio/ yet, so those lines would name files it does not
# have.  The few files the starters name ship beside them, in
# exlex/starters/assets/images/ and audio/, all called `starter-...`; the
# editor's preview of a document not saved yet shows them from there
# (server.api_preview), and a save gives the document its own copy of each
# one it names and lacks (adopt_starter_media) -- after which it is the
# document's file like any other, to delete or take away in a zip.

# name missing and copied it in again would undo the owner's ✕ in Images…
# or Recordings… behind their back, while the page had just told them the
# embed would break.  So the document's meta.json lists, under
# "starter_media", the starter's files it has held
# ("images/starter-apple.svg"), and a name listed there is never copied in
# again: deleted, it is missing wherever the document is shown, as a file
# of the document's own would be, until the owner uploads one under that

    """Documents out of a zip -> {"docs": [meta, ...], "warnings": [...]}.

    A ZIP OF ZIPS IS OPENED FIRST (_unwrap_zip_of_zips): that is the shape
    the library's own download of several documents with their media has,
    and the answer says how many were found in it.

    Every .md or .markdown file in it is a document, and the pictures it
    shows are read from beside it -- its folder's images/, or its folder --
    and stored with the document, and so are the recordings it names (its
    folder's audio/, or its folder); a name the store spells otherwise
    (Cat.PNG is kept as cat.png, a WAV called word.mp3 as word.wav) is
    written that way into the markdown.  A picture or a recording the
    markdown shows that the zip does not hold, or that the store refuses, is
    a warning and not a refusal -- unless it is one of the starters' own,
    which comes from where they ship (adopt_starter_media), as it does when
    the same markdown is uploaded on its own.

    `headers` maps a markdown file's path in the zip to the header fields to
    add to it, or to None to leave that file out.  A file whose header is
    incomplete, with no fields given for it, raises HeaderNeeded before
    anything is made -- naming every such file, with what it lacks and what
    to offer -- so the upload can ask for them all and send the zip again.

    Then the names: a file whose title is a document's of this library, or
    another file's in the zip, raises NameConflict before anything is made,
    and `renames` is the dialog's answer (plan_names)."""
