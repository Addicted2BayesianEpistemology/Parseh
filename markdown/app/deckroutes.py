"""deckroutes — the exercise decks over HTTP, mounted at /exercises.

The same routes answer in both servers: inside Parseh (../../serve.py hands
it every /exercises/... request) and beside the studio when the studio runs
on its own (server.py does the same).  So this module must NOT import
server.py: serve.py loads that file under another module name, and a second
import would make a second, unconfigured copy of the studio.  What it needs
from the studio arrives instead through two calls server.py makes when it
loads -- set_studio_base (where the studio's static files and pages are) and
set_shutdown (what the Stop button runs) -- and one serve.py makes, since
only Parseh has books and videos: set_notes_resolver (which notes library a
notes page's address stands for, so "+ Deck" works in a note too).

The handler `h` given to dispatch offers only what both servers' handlers
share: h.query, h._body(), h._json_body(), h.send_bytes, h.send_json,
h.send_html, h.send_file, and in Parseh possibly h._spool -- a temp file
holding a body too large to keep in memory (an imported deck).

The work is decks.py's; this is the translation to and from HTTP: its errors
become statuses (NotFound 404, Conflict 409 with its kind, DeckError 400),
and every JSON answer carries "ok".
