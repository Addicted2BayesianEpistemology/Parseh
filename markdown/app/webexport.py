"""webexport — a document, or a deck's chosen exercises, as ONE HTML file.

TO-DO §8.38 and §9.7: a page to drop into a website, for students who have
no Parseh.  It is opened from a file:// link or off a plain static host with
no server of any kind behind it, and it is much less than the studio -- that
is the point:

  * EVERYTHING TRAVELS WITH IT.  The sheet's styles, the faces it is set in
    (cut down to the letters the page uses), the pictures, the recordings --
    cut down to the stretches the page plays, where this machine has ffmpeg
    -- and the script that makes the exercises work are all inside the one
    file.  The one thing it reaches out for is a YouTube video the document
    embeds, which plays in YouTube's own player (the owner's choice).
  * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION.  What is shipped is the RENDER, never the
    Markdown: the attributes the studio writes so that its editor can find a
    block again (the source of a target-language line, the line numbers, the
    occurrence counters) are taken off, a link to another document of the
    library keeps its words and loses everything else, and the pieces of the
    studio that write -- the ✎ buttons, the layout ⚙, + Deck, the colour
    palette -- are not in it.  Nor is the code behind them: the script is a
    slice of app.js, the functions an exercise needs to be answered and
    marked and nothing that could save anything (_runtime).
  * IT WRITES NOWHERE.  The page carries its own Content-Security-Policy, so
    no request can leave it (no connect, no form, no worker), and its script
    runs over a storage of its own that is forgotten with the tab -- the
    choices a reader makes (a theme, hiding the transliterations) last as long
    as the tab and are never written into the browser.  Nothing is scheduled:
    a deck's exercises are crammed, the way its cram page does, and a closed
    tab has changed nothing anywhere.

The answers are in the file, plainly, as the studio page holds them: a page
that marks the student's answers must know them (the owner's choice).  At
its foot the page says it was exported from Parseh, with links to Parseh's
page on GitHub and to its guide (_footer), followed only when clicked.

    document_html(doc_id, meta, markdown, media)   -> (filename, bytes)
    deck_html(deck, items, media)                  -> (filename, bytes)

`media(path)` answers the file on disk that the Markdown's `images/x.png` or
`audio/x.mp3` names, or None.  The two routes that use this are the
document's Download ▾ (server.serve_download, kind "html") and the deck's
"Export selected to HTML" (deckroutes.api_export_html).

# page's path (strict-origin-when-cross-origin, what YouTube asks for).
