     card and works out what each rating would cost, and no scheduler was
     ever written for the phone, because two of them drift apart and the
     learner pays for it.  So there is nothing here that could answer this
     page -- and nothing kept could have been.

     What it used to do was find that out the slow way: the ask went to a
     door nobody was going to answer, the worker waited out its patience, and
     the page ended on a fetch's complaint about a server.  What can be done
     instead is said here, in the place the waiting used to be: cram the deck
     now, and take it out next time the computer is there.

     AND THE WAY OUT HAS TO BE AN ADDRESS THE PHONE ACTUALLY HAS, which is
     the whole point of offering it here: this panel is only ever drawn with
     the computer out of reach.  It used to read `cram?all=1`, and what
     lib/offline.py keeps when a deck is kept is the BARE cram address -- it
     cannot keep anything else, since an address carrying a selection would
     be a different address for every selection and none of them the one that
     was kept.  The worker matches a page by its path AND its query
     (lib/sw.js, `ignoreSearch: false`), so the one link Parseh offered a
     learner stranded away from his computer missed the copy sitting on his
     phone by five characters and landed him on /m/offline/.

     So the whole deck is asked for in the FRAGMENT instead.  A fragment is
     never part of a request -- the browser does not send it and the Cache
     API leaves it out when it matches -- so `cram#all` is, to the worker and
     to the network alike, the very address that was kept, while the cram
     page can still read it off `location`.  The old query is still understood
     there, for a link somebody has kept or bookmarked. */

     The exercises are rendered by the computer -- there is nothing on a
     phone that could render one -- and until today the ask that did it was a
     POST carrying the picked ids.  A service worker cannot cache a POST at
     all, whatever is kept: so a phone away from the computer had nothing to
     answer this page with, and it sat on "Loading exercises…" until it was
     closed.  Keeping a deck could never have made cramming work, however
     faithfully everything else was kept.

     Beside the POST there is now a GET at the same address which renders the
     WHOLE deck -- every exercise, nothing chosen, nothing in the address to
     vary -- and that is precisely what makes it keepable.  Keeping a deck
     keeps it, with the pictures and the recordings those exercises ask for
     (deckroutes api_cram_all, lib/offline.py deck()).

     Which of the two is asked: with the computer there, the POST, because it
     alone knows about an exercise added a minute ago and it renders only
     what was picked.  With the computer away -- or when the POST goes
     unanswered -- the GET, whose copy is on this phone; the picks are then
     taken out of the whole deck here.  "Cram all" of the whole deck asks the

   Studying writes, and a phone away from the computer cannot write there.  So
   a phone that wants to study on a train TAKES THE DECK OUT: the computer
   hands over the whole queue -- every card that is due, in its order,
   rendered, with the four interval labels IT worked out -- and will not study
   or edit that deck until it comes back.  Cramming on the computer is
   untouched: cram never schedules.

   The phone shows the cards it was handed, records what was answered, and
   sends the answers whenever the computer can be reached; the computer
   replays them through its own scheduler, in the order they were given.  That
   is why there is no scheduler here: one scheduler, no drift.

   The deck stays the phone's until "Give it back", so it can be studied day
   after day without taking it out again (the owner's choice, 2026-09-22). */

   So the EMPTY stretch of that column, between the buttons, scrolls the
   exercise: a finger dragged up or down there moves the page, one pixel of
   page to one pixel of finger, and leaves it flying on when the finger is
   lifted -- slowing down as a phone's own scrolling does, and stopping dead
   at the top and the bottom.  The buttons do not move, and a tap on one is
   still a tap: nothing here touches them, since the strip is its own box
   between them, and it alone says touch-action:none.

   The grip in its middle is there only while there is something to scroll. */
