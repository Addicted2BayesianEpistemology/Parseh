   `fetch` gives up when the socket does.  A socket towards a computer that
   has been switched off is REFUSED, in microseconds -- that is what this
   desk sees, and it is why every page of this toolbox behaved perfectly
   here.  A socket towards a computer on the far side of a tunnel that has
   gone is SWALLOWED: the connection is made and no answer ever comes, for
   ever.  Only a phone meets the second kind.  lib/sw.js cannot rescue it
   either, because it answers GETs alone (`r.method !== 'GET'`), so every
   write on every page of this app had no deadline anywhere in the stack.

   A BLANKET TIMEOUT WOULD BE THE WRONG MEND.  Importing a deck, packing a
   backup, building a PDF: these are honestly slow and must not be cut off
   at three seconds because a phone might have been in a tunnel.  So the ask
   is not timed -- it is WATCHED.  Every few seconds, while it is still out,
   the one cheap question is asked beside it: is anybody there?  A computer
   that answers that goes on being waited for however long it needs; a
   computer that does not is gone, and the ask fails at once and says so
   (`away`), which is what every offline fallback in this app keys off. */

   For each clash this asks for two names: one for the document already in

   name}} -- and the server checks every name again, together: a name still
   taken comes back as a problem shown under its own field, and the dialog
   stays open for another.  Resolves to the answer that went through
   ({status, ok, data}), or to null when cancelled: nothing was written.
   `verb` says what the incoming document is being: "saved" or "added".

   The first answer may refuse a name the page itself sent -- a backup's
   second pass (Replace) goes with the names its first pass was given --

   THE SAME CARD, ONLY BIGGER.  A card's fields are not all centred: a
   paragraph of right-to-left text sits on the right, a Latin block is
   justified, a field of several blocks starts where its lines start -- and
   what puts them there is the page around the card as much as the card:
   the sheet's typography (its "justify", its sizes), the direction and
   language of the exercise it is in, and the card's width, which decides
   which lines wrap and so which fields fill the card.  A copy set loose in
   a window as wide as the screen had none of that, and every line of it
   came out centred.  So the copy is laid out as the card on the page is --
   at the card's own width, in its own text size, inside that same context --
   and only then magnified whole, by a transform: the lines break where they
   break on the page (they are laid out at the page's size, and a zoom that
   laid them out again at the larger one would break a long paragraph a word
   differently), and every picture, player and margin keeps its place and
   its proportion.  How much larger is what the window holds: the whole
   card, the taller of its two sides deciding, when that is at least half as
   large again; a card too tall for that is drawn at least that large, never
   wider than the window, and scrolls.

   ON A PHONE the card on the page is already nearly as wide as the window,
   and a card magnified whole can grow no more than that -- a third or so,
   the rest of the window left empty.  There the copy is laid out narrower
   than the card on the page instead, at the window's width divided by the
   magnification, and magnified to the window's width: every field, picture
   and player as it is on the page, in the page's text size and context.
   Narrower, a line may break that did not break on the page, and a card
   whose short fields -- a word, its meaning, a sentence -- wrap onto two
   lines is no longer the card on the page, only bigger.  So no line breaks
   that is whole on the page: a field, a paragraph or a line of a Jolly
   field (up to its ⏎) that is one line there is one line enlarged, and
   only a paragraph that already wraps on the page may wrap at other words.
   Nor is a picture or a player laid out any narrower than on the page: a
   figure is a share of its field's width, and a card's picture or a
   recording that fills its field narrows with it, so laid out narrower
   they would come out smaller beside the words than on the page -- a
   recording a few centimetres wide losing its timeline -- in the very
   window that is there to show them.
   The magnification is as much as that allows, and the window's height,
   up to ZOOM_RELAID_AT_MOST, and never so much that anything is wider than
   its box at the narrower width that is not on the page (a word sticking
   out of the card, a table that would scroll).  Where that is hardly more
   than magnifying the card whole -- less than ZOOM_RELAID_GAIN times as
   much -- or where even the card magnified whole is too tall for the
   window, it is magnified whole at the page's width instead, as far as
   the window's width allows, every line where it is on the page; one too
   tall scrolls. */

     filled place's cloud can empty it.  The bank stays where it is, and says

     whole library wear a tag is no use once a filter is on: what the reader
     wants to know is how many of the ones in front of them it would leave.
     So the numbers are counted from the documents the last query returned,
     narrowed by the language chip, and a tag that would leave none is not
     offered at all -- it could only ever empty the page.

     A TAG DOING THE FILTERING ALWAYS STAYS, whatever its count. An excluded
     tag shows zero by its very nature (those documents are the ones being

   together -- two bars pinned are a good part of a phone's screen however
   short app.css makes them there, and one left standing is the reading
   page's whole problem.  Near the top they stand, as everywhere: there that
