/* exlex studio — THE GEAR of a document, of the editor and of the exercises
   (a0.5.0, plan §6).

   Every page of Parseh has one panel for the settings of the page it is on, a
   ⚙ in its bar (lib/pagesettings.js draws the button and the panel; this file
   says what is IN it, for five pages of the studio: `body[data-page]` is doc,
   edit, deck, study or cram).  What each of them held before is in the panel
   now, as a row with a name and one sentence:

     a document   Text · Exercises · Page · Zoom · Colours · Interface
     the editor   Text · Zoom · Colours · Editor              (no phone layout)
     a deck, studying it, cramming it
                  Text (four rows) · Exercises · Zoom · Colours · Interface

   THE ROWS ARE THE PAGE'S OWN STATE, NOT COPIES OF IT.  The text rows read and
   write what app.js keeps (studioTypo: the same two keys of localStorage, the
   same sheet, the PDF's scale), the two exercise switches turn what a card's
   own buttons turn (setTransliterationsHidden, setDragOn), "Hide the bars" is
   the bars' own button's (setBarsOff), the editor's direction is the one of
   its ⇤ RTL button.  Each says so to the others (`parseh:studio`, studioTypo's
   subscribers), so a row follows a change made anywhere else on the page while
   the panel is up -- and neither side has a second copy to drift from the
   first.  The Text group of the pages of exercises is the documents' own: one
   stored value (exlex-typo:global), so what is set in one is read in the
   other.

   `Aa` (a document's toolbar) opens the gear at its Text group, on every
   width; there is one set of sliders in Parseh and this is where it is.

   THE THEME has one function for every page of the studio (app.js,
   paintTheme): the gear's Colours hand it in as `apply`, and ◐ on the bars
   is the same function's.

   WHERE THE BUTTON STANDS.  In the browser layout: the right end of the bar's
   row of buttons, after ◐ (templates carry both in a `.bar-tail`, which keeps
   them on the screen where that row scrolls sideways).  On a phone: the
   mobile bar, after ◐ -- and on the study and cram pages, which have no bar
   there, the row of the exercise's title.  The Browser | Mobile switch left
   the bars of the pages that have a gear and lives in its Interface group.

   A studio run alone has no /lib/ of the toolbox's, bar the two files of the
   gear that server.py answers for itself; without lib/prefs.js the theme stays
   on this device and the panel says so. */
