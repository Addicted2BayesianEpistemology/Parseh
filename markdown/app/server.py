"""exlex studio — local web UI for the exlex toolchain.

    python3 app/server.py [--port 8766] [--open]     # on its own, plain http

Normally it is not run like this at all: the studio is one of the doors of
Parseh, and ../../serve.py serves it at https://…/studio/ together with the
book reader, the video player and the exercise decks (deckroutes.py, at
/exercises/).  The route table, the page functions and the API below are
what that server drives; this file's own main() remains for running the
studio alone, and mounts the exercise decks at the same /exercises/.

Zero third-party dependencies for the web app itself (stdlib http.server);
the PDF build reuses the exlex modules (XeLaTeX + PyMuPDF verification).
Binds to 127.0.0.1 only — this is a personal, local tool.

    prompt installed.
    """
    parts = ["""
## Mixed-direction sequences for %s — binding

First decide the direction of the **containing expression**, independently of
the direction inside each target-language run.

- A continuous %s phrase or sentence is one RTL unit. Write its words in
  normal logical/read-aloud order inside a single `[...]{tl}` mark (or as the
  dialect otherwise permits). Never reverse characters, words, or punctuation
  inside that unit.
- A question, answer, choice, derivation, list, table cell, label, explanation,
  or flashcard field can instead be an **LTR-framed expression containing
  separate RTL components**. Operators and separators such as `+`, `→`, `=`,
  `/`, commas, parentheses, bullets, numbering, or intervening prose keep that
  surrounding expression LTR. Treat every separately marked RTL component as
  an indivisible visual box and write those boxes in the Markdown in the order
  they must appear **from left to right on the finished page**. When the boxes
  are successive parts of an RTL word or phrase, this means reversing their
  linguistic/read-aloud order at the box level. Keep the text *inside* every
  box in its natural order and keep each LTR separator between the same two
  boxes.

For example, the Persian word *dānešgāh* is read and analysed from the right as
`dān + -eš + -gāh`, but an LTR answer that displays its isolated components
must be authored in this visual left-to-right order:

```markdown
[گاه]{#6B6B1A translit:-gāh} + [ش]{#C28E0E translit:-eš} + [دان]{translit:dān}
```

Do not put the read-first root `dān` in the leftmost visual box: isolating the
runs would display the component sequence backwards. This rule is general and
does not depend on the plus sign. Apply the same box-order test with every
operator, separator, label, or piece of surrounding LTR prose. Before returning
the Markdown, mentally inspect the rendered line from left to right, then
verify that reading its RTL components from right to left gives the intended
linguistic order. This box-level source ordering is the only reversal involved;
it does not conflict with the rule never to reverse text inside an RTL run.
""".strip() % (target.name, target.name)]
    if exercises:
        parts.append("""
For exercises, apply that rule to every learner-visible field: the exercise
prompt, each answer or selectable segment, both sides of a matching pair,
explanations, and embedded flashcard fields. Do not assume that wrapping each
individual RTL chunk is sufficient; check the order of the chunks in their LTR
container.

A fill sentence is the one place where that box-order question does not
arise, because the sentence is not a row of LTR boxes: write it as ONE
target-language mark with its blanks inside, in natural logical order, and
never reverse anything in it.

```markdown
:::exercise fill-blanks
prompt: Complete the phrase below using the correct option.
text: [من بابک [[slot]]]{tl}
- [slot] [هَستَم]{tl}
- [ ] [است]{tl}
- [ ] [هَست]{tl}
:::
```

The mark is spread over the pieces round each blank when the document is
parsed, and the sentence as a whole is then laid out right to left, so each
blank is drawn where it is read. A blank that opens the sentence is written
`text: [[[slot]] شُما چیه؟]{tl}` — the first bracket opens the mark, and
`[[slot]]` is the blank. The answer row names the same blank: `- [slot] …`.
Write the blanks in the order they are read, not in any visual order, and do
not set `content-direction` for such a sentence; it needs none.

For `construct-sentence`, movable chunks follow the target language's reading
direction by default. Number them in spoken/logical order. For a sentence whose
spoken/logical order is `first_word second_word`, write exactly this pattern:

```markdown
:::exercise construct-sentence
prompt: Construct the sentence.
- [1] [first_word]{tl}
- [2] [second_word]{tl}
:::
```

Thus `first_word` occupies the rightmost slot and is read first from the right;
if the answer wraps, its next line starts at the right edge too. Use
`answer-direction: rtl` or `answer-direction: ltr` only when this particular
answer needs a different flow from the target language. This is separate from
`content-direction`, which controls the activity body's writing direction.
`order-sentences` remains a vertical list in normal chronological/logical order.
